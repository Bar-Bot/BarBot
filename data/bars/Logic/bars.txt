I feel like I'm out of my mind<eob>
It feel like my life ain't mine<eob>
(Who can relate? Woo!)<eob>
I've been on the low<eob>
I been taking my time<eob>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<eob>
It feel like my life ain't mine<eob>
I don't wanna be alive<eob>
I don't wanna be alive<eob>
I just wanna die today<eob>
I just wanna die<eob>
I don't wanna be alive<eob>
I don't wanna be alive<eob>
I just wanna die<eob>
And let me tell you why<eob>
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it<eob>
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic<eob>
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it<eob>
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it<eob>
I never had a place to call my own<eob>
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone<eob>
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?<eob>
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine<eob>
I've been on the low<eob>
I been taking my time<eob>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<eob>
It feel like my life ain't mine<eob>
(Who can relate? Woo!)<eob>

You don't gotta die today<eob>
You don't gotta die<eob>
I want you to be alive<eob>
I want you to be alive<eob>
You don't gotta die<eob>
Now lemme tell you why<eob>
It's the very first breath<eob>
When your head's been drowning underwater<eob>
And it's the lightness in the air<eob>
When you're there<eob>
Chest to chest with a lover<eob>
It's holding on, though the road's long<eob>
And seeing light in the darkest things<eob>
And when you stare at your reflection<eob>
Finally knowing who it is<eob>
I know that you'll thank God you did<eob>
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'<eob>
I know you're the reason I believe in life<eob>
What's the day without a little night?<eob>
I'm just tryna shed a little light<eob>
It can be hard<eob>
It can be so hard<eob>
But you gotta live right now<eob>
You got everything to give right now<eob>
I've been on the low<eob>
I been taking my time<eob>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<eob>
It feel like my life ain't mine<eob>
(Who can relate? Woo!)<eob>
I've been on the low<eob>
I been taking my time<eob>
I feel like I'm out of my mind<eob>
It feel like my life ain't mine<eob>
I finally wanna be alive<eob>
I finally wanna be alive<eob>
I don't wanna die today<eob>
I don't wanna die<eob>
I finally wanna be alive<eob>
I finally wanna be alive<eob>
I don't wanna die<eob>
I don't wanna die<eob>
Pain don't hurt the same, I know<eob>
The lane I travel feels alone<eob>
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out<eob>
And I see my tears melt in the snow<eob>
But I don't wanna cry<eob>
I don't wanna cry anymore<eob>
I wanna feel alive<eob>
I don't even wanna die anymore<eob>
Oh I don't wanna<eob>
I don't wanna<eob>
I don't even wanna die anymore<eob>
Yeah, uh, yeah<eob>

Bullet to the dome like an Aleve<eob>

No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop<eob>
‘Fore they even call the cops<eob>
Do it for the money and the bitches<eob>
And the drugs and the props<eob>

Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way<eob>
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away<eob>
I imagine a better life<eob>
Where I never had a debt in life<eob>
Hit you with the {gunshots} in the dead of night<eob>
Sellin' crack to my own pops<eob>
Pushin' this weight on my own block<eob>
If I sell a brick I can buy a house<eob>
If they find the key they might lock me up<eob>
But I take the chance<eob>
'Cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<eob>
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<eob>

In my blood is the slave and the master<eob>
It's like the devil playin spades with the pastor<eob>
But he was born with the white privilege!<eob>
Man what the fuck is that?<eob>
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin with his toys<eob>
I should be ashamed to be black<eob>
And some black people look ashamed when I rap<eob>
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back<eob>
Not accepted by the black or the white<eob>

You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me<eob>
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me<eob>
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still<eob>
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel<eob>
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser<eob>
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone<eob>
And as for... he left and he ain’t coming back<eob>
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that<eob>
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting an' selling that<eob>
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back<eob>
I been working hard, I been searching for God<eob>
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud<eob>
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me<eob>
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me<eob>
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure<eob>
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother<eob>
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya<eob>
Tried to call ya, where are ya?<eob>
In Paris? What a beautiful destination<eob>
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful<eob>
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk<eob>
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad<eob>
It gets me thinking 'bout incredible moments we've had<eob>
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you<eob>
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?<eob>

I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom<eob>
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm<eob>
Maybe you could tell *beep*<eob>
I've been feeling under pressure<eob>
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga<eob>
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant<eob>
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent<eob>
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it<eob>
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place<eob>
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl<eob>
It fell through, man, what a world<eob>
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff<eob>
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft<eob>
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss<eob>
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce<eob>
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors<eob>
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior<eob>
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through<eob>
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?<eob>
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul<eob>
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now<eob>
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel<eob>
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?<eob>
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined<eob>
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing<eob>
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth<eob>
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth<eob>
This is everything I love, this is everything I need<eob>
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed<eob>
This is everything I love, everything I need<eob>
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed<eob>
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure<eob>
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye<eob>
I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins<eob>
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain<eob>
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you<eob>
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you<eob>
Maybe I’m just not as strong as I once was<eob>
When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz<eob>
I’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs<eob>
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go<eob>
Cause in the end what happens you already know<eob>
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low<eob>
But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for<eob>
All these other bitches on my dick but I can’t fuck with that<eob>
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back<eob>
Even though you turn my lungs black<eob>

I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing<eob>
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy<eob>
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me<eob>
Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first<eob>
Me and you together, swear to God that’s all that worked<eob>
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work<eob>
Uh, my heart is hard at work<eob>
We been together like ten years<eob>
Goddamn, took me as young man<eob>
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go<eob>
What will they write upon my grave?<eob>
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave<eob>
But everything he gave her was for nothing though<eob>
Oh no I can’t fade that shit I gotta let you go<eob>
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas<eob>
All this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous<eob>
All I know is I’m living the life I never would<eob>
Finally let you go, I thought I never could<eob>
Don’t get me wrong, can’t forget the times shared<eob>
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there<eob>
Tried to run but my legs won’t<eob>
I look away but my head don’t<eob>
I love it when you’re fresh<eob>
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath<eob>
I hate it that I need you, Nikki<eob>
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki<eob>
I hate that I bleed for you<eob>
Uh, I long and I need for you<eob>
But I love it when I taste you<eob>
Nothing can replace you<eob>
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go<eob>
But you’re everywhere I long to be<eob>
And all these other people that don’t seem to understand<eob>
I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me<eob>
Man you’re everything I crave<eob>
You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave<eob>
I’m a king, you’re my Coretta<eob>
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine<eob>
Slave for the—<eob>
Said, I’m a slave for the nicotine<eob>
Been a slave for ya<eob>
I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya<eob>
Slave for the nicotine<eob>
Nikki, Nikki, slave for ya<eob>
I’m a slave for ya Nikki<eob>
I’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya<eob>
All handwriting on the album's artwork was done by Big Lenbo—<eob>
Jesus, Black Jesus<eob>
Jesus, Black Jesus<eob>

I think they should know what's up<eob>
That's that road I been down<eob>
I know how it go down<eob>
I know how it go now, what's up<eob>
I feel like I don’t belong<eob>
I feel like my life is wrong<eob>
I feel like I don’t know what's up<eob>
What's up, what's up<eob>
Yeah, yeah<eob>
Ayy<eob>
I ain’t here to pick and choose<eob>
I ain't here to sing the blues<eob>
I’m just here to spread the clues<eob>
I’m just here to spread the news<eob>
Everybody know I do<eob>
Listen<eob>
I ain’t ashamed to be white<eob>
I ain’t ashamed to be Black<eob>
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact<eob>
I know you fucking with that<eob>
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be<eob>
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be<eob>
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good<eob>
Sometimes I’m misunderstood<eob>
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off<eob>
They feel like I'm fading<eob>
I'm right out my mind<eob>
Tell 'em!<eob>
Momma don't love me<eob>
Daddy don't love me<eob>
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly<eob>
You could be anything you wanna be<eob>
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be<eob>
Let him hate let em love<eob>
Wondering if everybody still like this up above<eob>
When that push come to shove<eob>
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like<eob>
I just wanna be free<eob>
Not a slave to the stereotype<eob>
All alone in my room in the middle of the night<eob>
I don’t have the words but my stereo might<eob>
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today<eob>
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye<eob>
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin<eob>
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him<eob>
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone<eob>
Looking for a man and a home to call my own<eob>
But I already have one<eob>
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son<eob>
Son, say:<eob>
Black is beautiful<eob>
Be black and proud<eob>
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud<eob>

Just ride with a mothafucka<eob>
Keep it real, never lie to a mothafucka, hold me down<eob>
Chillin', In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, rockin' Adidas<eob>
With a señorita when she sippin' liquor by the liter<eob>
That's royalty, like the homie Gambino<eob>
He know we be in the casino, lightin' Cubans with a C-note<eob>
I'ma fuck the game, dare you to test my libido<eob>
Comin' up shorter than Danny DeVito<eob>
Whenever I step on the beat, ho<eob>
Like a killer on the creep flow<eob>
Had my share of defeat, but we still gon' eat, ho<eob>
While the fans bumpin' Welcome To Forever on repeat though<eob>
Wonderin' if I'ma ever fall off<eob>
Feelin' mad at the world, wanna hit it with a sawed-off<eob>
Blowin' up like a molotov<eob>
This is war, everybody, ain’t no reason I'ma call it off<eob>
Get it right, shout out to the homie Dizzy Wright<eob>
In the studio everyday<eob>

Oh my God, they plottin' and schemin'<eob>
Fuckboys rather me not even breathin'<eob>
They tryna take my blessings away<eob>
They gotta be demons, I'm blessed everyday<eob>
And not blessed like I'm sneezin', I'm healthy and well<eob>
On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'<eob>
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy<eob>
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'<eob>
Got Champagne problems, and I order more<eob>
My wardrobe is Aura Gold<eob>
I'm a young nigga with a older soul<eob>
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more<eob>
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician<eob>
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician<eob>
She tryna hold on to a nigga sta-sta-stackin' up<eob>
Purell for these fake niggas tryna dap dap me up<eob>
Hype nigga, back-back-back it up<eob>
Claimin' that we homies, boy stop<eob>

Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same<eob>
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela<eob>
Hit you with a Beretta, get you wetter than a umbrella<eob>
Ain't nobody better do it like me<eob>
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me<eob>
Probably wanna fight me<eob>
But I just keep the peace, no need to keep a piece<eob>
I keep my enemies on a leash, capiche?<eob>
And keep it real for the people I reach<eob>
Uh a-ah, yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah<eob>

(Way, way, way), fade away<eob>
They gon' know my name until it fade away<eob>
(Okay, okay)<eob>
I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit I run that<eob>
Motherfucker this far from a comeback, if one of us fall then we run back<eob>
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my kin, gotta get my son back<eob>
Cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you (you, you, you)<eob>
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday<eob>
Driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day<eob>
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce<eob>
Never regretted, the second I said it I feel like I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit<eob>
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder ya predicate, bitch I'm ahead of it, yeah<eob>
Yes I'ma die but I don’t wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it yeah<eob>
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable<eob>
Okay-kay, hold up let me say yes I fade away<eob>
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away<eob>
They gon' know my name until it fade—<eob>

Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this<eob>
I might just, might just, I don't know<eob>
Reinvention, that's my intention<eob>
Want so much more than this third-dimension<eob>
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture<eob>
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya<eob>
But it will hit ya like, "goddamn!"<eob>
Going HAM, full of all of them<eob>
In a spaceship, I’m in another system<eob>
So futuristic, on another mission<eob>
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen<eob>
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission<eob>
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain<eob>
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame<eob>
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer<eob>
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya<eob>
Sit back and really get the picture<eob>
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away<eob>

THOMAS: Get the upgrade?<eob>
KAI: Nah, man. It’s the same shit with a different title!<eob>
THALIA: That’s not true, Kai<eob>
KAI: What the fuck?!<eob>
THOMAS: Yeah, man. They didn’t just upgrade features, they enhanced her A.I<eob>
KAI: So she can actually hold a conversation?<eob>
THOMAS: Yeah. Ask her yourself<eob>
KAI: Uh, what am I thinking, Thalia?<eob>
THALIA: Kai, I’m a program in the ship’s interface, not a psychic<eob>
KAI: Damn, girl!<eob>
THOMAS: Yeah, that’s another thing now. She’s unisex<eob>
KAI: What?!<eob>
THOMAS: Thalia, integrate Y chromosome feature<eob>
THALIA: Sure thing, Thomas. Would you like a standard accent or something a little more exotic?<eob>
KAI: Holy shit!<eob>
THOMAS: Told you, man. The upgrade’s crazy. Thalia, revert last command and run simulation<eob>
THALIA: Running simulation<eob>
KAI: Man, what the hell is that?<eob>
THOMAS: Well, you can pick anyone in history, and based off a collection of data, it allows you to personally speak with them<eob>
KAI: Anybody?<eob>
THOMAS: Anybody<eob>
KAI: Thalia, do Big Sean<eob>
THOMAS: All right, let me get this straight. You can speak with anyone in recorded history, like Jesus, Steve Jobs, Einstein, and you pick Big Sean?<eob>
KAI: Man, fuck yeah! That’s my dog!<eob>
THOMAS: *Laughs* Okay. Thalia, simulate Big Sean<eob>
THALIA: What up Kai, you lil' bitch?<eob>
KAI: Yeah, I'ma have to upgrade my shit<eob>
If you're dealing war, backwards stay far<eob>
We're dealing with truths and rights<eob>
Come some more into my sight<eob>
(You no hear me yet?)<eob>
(Hear me live and direct)<eob>
(Walk with your tap)<eob>
Yeah, in London talkin' to Rhetorik 'bout my life and shit<eob>
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit<eob>
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged<eob>
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same<eob>
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome<eob>
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm<eob>
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation<eob>
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and<eob>
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement<eob>
It ain't about the money and notoriety<eob>
It's about the people and making a difference in society<eob>
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie<eob>
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi<eob>
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?<eob>
Same level, the same rebel that never settled<eob>
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto<eob>
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered<eob>
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances<eob>
I used to spend all my time conversing with you<eob>
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you<eob>
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet<eob>
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street<eob>
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside<eob>
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide<eob>
That misconception, "'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride"<eob>
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied<eob>
People in my ear telling me, "Talk that shit"<eob>
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit<eob>
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label<eob>
Within six months I put the second one on they table<eob>
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce<eob>
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce<eob>
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce<eob>
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce<eob>
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand<eob>
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand<eob>
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand<eob>
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand<eob>
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit<eob>
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit<eob>
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask<eob>
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass<eob>
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?<eob>
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne<eob>
Come some more into my sight...<eob>
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though<eob>
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though<eob>
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor<eob>
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44<eob>
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before<eob>
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro<eob>
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow<eob>
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow<eob>
I just wanna keep the peace and help people<eob>
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people<eob>
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil<eob>
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel<eob>
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo<eob>
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though<eob>
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!<eob>
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know<eob>
I heard you've got a fucking problem bitch I bet I beast<eob>
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece<eob>
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah we leave ‘em deceased<eob>
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capeesh, homie waddup!<eob>
Let me bring it back down<eob>
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)<eob>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)<eob>
Back where I came from now<eob>
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down<eob>
They think it's a game right now<eob>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now<eob>
Back where I came from now<eob>
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down<eob>
I hope you live a long life hatin'<eob>
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh<eob>
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan<eob>
But I got God on my side, always down to ride<eob>
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least<eob>
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease<eob>
Matter fact like a geneticist<eob>
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive<eob>
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars<eob>
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars<eob>
It's all love, man that shit is ours<eob>
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars<eob>
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world<eob>
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl<eob>
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah<eob>
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though<eob>
Keep it Rattpack till the beat go<eob>
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though<eob>
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor<eob>
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio<eob>
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant<eob>
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it<eob>
I don't give a fuck, my mindstate celibate<eob>
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich<eob>
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant<eob>
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they momma's<eob>
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics<eob>
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic<eob>
Let me bring it back down<eob>
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)<eob>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)<eob>
Back where I came from now<eob>
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down<eob>
They think it's a game right now<eob>
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now<eob>
Back where I came from now<eob>
We gon' live it up till we bring it back down<eob>
Mmmn, I'm thinking...<eob>

They say, "Logic, you too humble, boy, just let it out"<eob>
Fuck 'em all then, I'ma dead it now<eob>

And these motherfuckers wanna take up on every mistake<eob>
And I'm showing where I'm going<eob>
And I'm knowing what I'm doing, intuition never switching<eob>
On a mission, motherfucker, why is you bitching? Why is you bitching?<eob>
Like God damn, I'm like (oh God)<eob>
Hold up, wait a minute, they ain't ready for the hook<eob>
It's another day, another book<eob>
I feel like Indiana in Atlanta, hotter than Havana<eob>
Coming with the stamina<eob>
Bitch, put down your camera, and live in the moment<eob>
This shit right here, everybody gon' want it, so what up wit’ it?<eob>
Any and everybody talk about the boy changing<eob>
Y'all can just shut up wit’ it 'cause I know<eob>
Ain't none of y'all getting the flow, boy...<eob>
This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted<eob>
From the young boy, from the—from the—from the god<eob>
This that flexicution, this is what the people say they wanted<eob>
From the rap god, from the—from the—from the god<eob>
I'm like, "Oh, God, oh- oh, my God"<eob>
Bitch, I run the game, y'all just commentate from the side<eob>

It's been a hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)<eob>
Hell of a ride up (it's been a hell of a ride up)<eob>
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know<eob>
That I've been M.I.A, but I was tied up<eob>
Till I heard you talking shit, now I'm fired up<eob>
5-0 triple 0<eob>
Ayo, shout out to Black Diamond. I got them Nikes on my feet as we speak, homie. Shout out to Mac Miller<eob>
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money<eob>
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<eob>
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>
I'm one of a kind (Sinatra)<eob>
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money<eob>
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<eob>
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>
I'm one of a kind<eob>
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind<eob>
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme<eob>
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out<eob>
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out<eob>
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my<eob>
Good god, you know we fly<eob>
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by<eob>
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time<eob>
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th<eob>
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl<eob>
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire<eob>
Holla at honeys, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"<eob>
Baby what’s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?<eob>
(Cudi what up?)<eob>
It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire<eob>
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare<eob>
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money<eob>
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<eob>
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>

All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>
I'm one of a kind<eob>
This is the joint that when you hear it you like, "That’s my shit!"<eob>
Maybe at a house party while you getting lit<eob>
Or while you cruising 'round town riding in a whip<eob>
One thing’s for sure, you better get all of your friends here<eob>
If a shorty like my music, then she a (Bobbysoxer)<eob>
Got a booty, know how to use it, homie yes I rocks her<eob>
The second I jump on a stage, I’m rocking it, ain’t nobody stopping it<eob>
Whoever goes on after me, I’m sorry, you ain’t topping it<eob>
It’s going down, feeling like a millionaire<eob>
Riding with the top down, while the rest of the world just stare<eob>
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money<eob>
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<eob>

All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<eob>
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>
I'm one of a kind<eob>
Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game<eob>
While you worshipped other rappers that leave you less entertained<eob>
I was strategizing before the people knew my name<eob>
Fame what I shall attain on the road to success<eob>
Bumping Jay in the H.O.V. lane<eob>
Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain<eob>
Yo quiero dormir contigo mi amorcito<eob>
I know we fight, but that’s poquito<eob>
Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito<eob>
All I do is rhyme, all I do is get this money<eob>
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with honeys<eob>
All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>
I'm one of a kind<eob>

All I do is shine, tour the world, ain't it funny?<eob>
I'm one of a kind<eob>
Okay, it's RattPack 'til my pulse flat, we keep it real, no false rap<eob>

I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill<eob>
Number one, bitch, I bet it will, due to numbers, I said it will<eob>
I played the game and I'm still the same<eob>
And I'll never change, just to get a deal<eob>
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin'<eob>
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'<eob>
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion<eob>
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama<eob>
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas<eob>
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals<eob>
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel<eob>
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go<eob>
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know<eob>
I'ma live life 'til I overdose<eob>
While they sleepin' on me, that's comatose<eob>
I went mainstream with my main team<eob>
You just mad as fuck, you ain't come close<eob>
And ya' next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl<eob>
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl<eob>
Bitch I'm back again and I'll run it<eob>
Always gotta keep it one hundred<eob>
All of y'all know y'all want it, turn it up and get blunted<eob>
I'm like, "Fuck the money, fuck the fame"<eob>
I came here to fuck up the game, gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself<eob>
Fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone<eob>
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up<eob>
Talkin' that shit, but they'll never admit<eob>
When I step to the mic I be murderin' it<eob>
And we livin' real good, mainstream, but it's still good<eob>
I got raw shit, I got real shit<eob>
But right now it's time for that feel good<eob>
We call that "ballin'", doin' this is my callin'<eob>
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin'<eob>
I'm like, "Yeah, what it do?", penthouse, man, what a view<eob>
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through<eob>
With my whole team, they coming too<eob>

Yeah, you know that we ballin', we been goin' all-in<eob>
Hold on, let me slow it down, so y'all get the shit<eob>
These haters talk, but I don't give a shit<eob>
Got models, bottles, and the piff is lit<eob>
But we ballin', kinda like Spalding and Rawlings<eob>
On the road to riches never stallin'<eob>
Got your girl all up all on my nuts<eob>
But she do it with joy, no almonds, ugh<eob>
Living life to perfection, VIP, that's the section<eob>
Presidential watch, presidential suites<eob>
You would think we held an election<eob>
It go Logic first, then I'm up next<eob>
I do not converse, I just cut checks<eob>
I do not rehearse, I just drop the verse<eob>
I need to cop a hearse, 'cause I'm fresh to death<eob>
I bet you never seen so much designer<eob>
Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer<eob>
Boy, I stunt when I ain't even tryna<eob>
Swaggin' is nice, but first I'ma rhymer<eob>
And I rep Maryland, home of the Terrapins<eob>
Say you spit crack, homie, we spit that heroin<eob>
Bring it right to your front door like I'm carolin'<eob>
Standing next to me would be so embarrassin'<eob>
Yeah, we be ballin'<eob>
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin'<eob>
I came from nothin' to somethin' like it's nothin'<eob>
Yeah, you know I done it, nah, there's no discussion<eob>
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama<eob>
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas<eob>
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals<eob>
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel<eob>
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they'll never go<eob>
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know<eob>
Goddamn, goddamn—conversations with legends<eob>
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren<eob>
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us<eob>
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus<eob>
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases<eob>
Better believe than think down and leave us, the baby cryin'<eob>
Crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food<eob>
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude<eob>
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him<eob>
I'll motherfuckin' kill him<eob>
I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't<eob>
'Cause if I do po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't<eob>
See my vision from pictures I paint<eob>
Do you feel it like I feel it?<eob>
I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone<eob>
As memories resurface from hella long in my past<eob>
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask<eob>
Little Bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby<eob>
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery<eob>
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store<eob>
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door<eob>
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A<eob>
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play<eob>
To this day I pay homage to the gods, to the greats<eob>
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland<eob>
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night<eob>
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon<eob>
Catch me rollin’ with the realest<eob>
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero<eob>
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas<eob>
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella<eob>
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa<eob>
Murder the game and then resurrect it like "Thriller"<eob>
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa<eob>
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love<eob>
Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs<eob>
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)<eob>
Hip-hop<eob>
I swear this music in my genes like Denim<eob>
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom<eob>
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer<eob>
Even though heaven sent him<eob>
See my vision as I've elevated and risen<eob>
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision<eob>
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division<eob>
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'<eob>
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings<eob>
While the label only care about making a killin'<eob>
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G—<eob>
—that's the shit they never see<eob>
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be<eob>
Bitch, I said, "I bet I be."<eob>
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me<eob>
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?<eob>
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?<eob>
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me<eob>
Just 'cause I was different<eob>
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?<eob>
And the fans they say they love you<eob>
But they push and they shove<eob>
'Cause they want what they want<eob>
How they want when they want it<eob>
I just gave them twenty songs<eob>
Now they want another hundred<eob>
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it<eob>
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted<eob>
While the rest of 'em just worry<eob>
'Bout bitches and getting blunted<eob>
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1<eob>
Only difference is I'm stronger<eob>
And better from when I've begun<eob>
So when people that never knew me<eob>
They tell me that I changed<eob>
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?<eob>
I just stop, and do my best to refrain<eob>
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane<eob>
Will I die? Will I live?<eob>
Give the world everything I have to give?<eob>
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age<eob>
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage<eob>
Even though it's in the millions<eob>
That shit don't define my brilliance<eob>
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions<eob>
Of people that separated, but all equal<eob>
To know the ending one must understand the prequel<eob>
I swear this music in my genes like Denim<eob>
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom<eob>
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer<eob>
Even though heaven sent him<eob>
Spit it like Holy water<eob>
Prophetically repent 'em, then we gone<eob>
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby<eob>
Like goddamn, like goddamn<eob>
This that 9-5 shit right here<eob>
Take 'em back to the 90s!<eob>
Like goddamn, like goddamn<eob>
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo<eob>
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice<eob>
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists<eob>
Take them back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace<eob>
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice<eob>
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant<eob>
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant<eob>
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance<eob>
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant<eob>
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant<eob>
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence<eob>
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce<eob>
Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic<eob>
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis<eob>
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate<eob>
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it<eob>
I'm, forever alone in my mind (yeah yeah)<eob>
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac<eob>
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at<eob>
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah<eob>
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious<eob>
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis<eob>
Better believe us or leave us<eob>
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"<eob>
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man<eob>
Bitches want an autograph<eob>
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!<eob>
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists<eob>
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O<eob>
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie<eob>
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie<eob>
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal<eob>
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Over here, over here<eob>
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious<eob>
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval<eob>
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval<eob>
I spit at it like a Beretta<eob>
You know I get better by givin' the people<eob>
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'<eob>
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden<eob>
"The Return of the Jedi"<eob>
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye<eob>
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do<eob>
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)<eob>
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio<eob>
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo<eob>
To hold a brother down like the white man<eob>
Fuck them, yo<eob>
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff<eob>
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real<eob>
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man<eob>
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)<eob>
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon<eob>
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love<eob>
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this<eob>
Throw a Molotov in your crib<eob>
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest<eob>
Finger fuck a critic<eob>
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"<eob>
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it<eob>
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom<eob>
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on<eob>
Living good, I've been living good<eob>
Rolling through my hood, understood<eob>
Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good<eob>
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me<eob>
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties<eob>
Out the blue, like a Crip<eob>
But I never bang, no, they know<eob>
We've been at it way before the fame, ho<eob>
(Way before the fame)<eob>
We've been at it way before the fame, ho<eob>
(Way before the...)<eob>
We've been at it way before the fame, psyche<eob>
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it<eob>
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch<eob>
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit<eob>
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this<eob>
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do<eob>
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue<eob>
I'm coming through<eob>
If I see your bitch I bet she coming too, what it do<eob>

Back again, like I never left<eob>

Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore<eob>

They know who I am<eob>
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce<eob>

With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa<eob>
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla<eob>
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross<eob>
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world<eob>
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl<eob>
RattPack, know the deal<eob>
What's the motto? Keep it real!<eob>
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it<eob>
We live in an era where they get deleted<eob>
I'm wondering if I'ma make it<eob>
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it<eob>
These bitches they love it, but I never covet<eob>
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing<eob>
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living<eob>
Don't know what I'm given<eob>

Out the blue, like a Crip<eob>
But I never bang though<eob>

(Pop bottles with my homies that be down with me)<eob>
Locations where the album were recorded include: No I.D's studio in Los Angeles, Logic's house in the hills, and various hotels across the country throughout the duration of the tour...<eob>
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<eob>
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood<eob>
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug<eob>
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug<eob>
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?<eob>
Tell me you love me, need me<eob>
Promise me you’ll never leave me<eob>
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street<eob>
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete<eob>
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat<eob>
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik<eob>
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters<eob>
Want to act like I’m adopted<eob>
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy<eob>
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it<eob>
My oh my (My oh my)<eob>
Oh my (My oh my)<eob>
I said oh my (Oh my)<eob>
Somebody pinch me<eob>
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black<eob>
So why the white man wanna lynch me?<eob>
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not<eob>
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought<eob>
Or black people said, shit<eob>
Maybe it’s in my head<eob>
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<eob>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<eob>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<eob>
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her<eob>
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater<eob>
Wondering what’s gonna happen<eob>
And how the world gonna treat her<eob>
How could her momma mislead her<eob>
And her daddy just leave her?<eob>
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever<eob>
Oh my<eob>
(Oh my) Oh my<eob>
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my<eob>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<eob>
Ohhh<eob>
Oh my, my, my, my, my<eob>
Oh my<eob>
I don’t feel right deep inside<eob>
Feeling like I need to hide<eob>
Everybody wonder why I get high<eob>
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside<eob>
Oh my, my, my<eob>
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah<eob>
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence<eob>
And all this shit is so intense<eob>
Don’t wanna go to this event<eob>
Just wanna stay home and invent<eob>
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent<eob>
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor<eob>
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling<eob>
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit<eob>
I know there's someone out there far away<eob>
Who's feeling all this shit<eob>
And yes I know that when I’m low<eob>
There's so much further I can go<eob>
And so I look up to the sky<eob>
Oh my, oh my<eob>
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my<eob>
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my<eob>
(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my<eob>
(I said oh)<eob>
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<eob>
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood<eob>
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug<eob>
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug<eob>
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?<eob>
Tell me you love me, need me<eob>
Promise me you’ll never leave me<eob>
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street<eob>
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete<eob>
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat<eob>
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik<eob>
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters<eob>
Want to act like I’m adopted<eob>
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy<eob>
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it<eob>
My oh my (My oh my)<eob>
Oh my (My oh my)<eob>
Like the white woman said oh my (Oh my)<eob>
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<eob>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<eob>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<eob>
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her<eob>
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<eob>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<eob>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<eob>
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her<eob>
Single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<eob>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<eob>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<eob>
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her<eob>
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater<eob>
Wondering what’s gonna happen<eob>
And how the world gonna treat her<eob>
How could her momma mislead her<eob>
And her daddy just leave her?<eob>
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever<eob>
Oh my<eob>

Everybody wonder why I get high<eob>
Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside<eob>
Oh my, my, my<eob>
Oh my, I said oh my<eob>
Sometimes I can’t get you out of my mind<eob>
Baby, no I just can’t find, I just can’t find<eob>
Such a beautiful state of mind<eob>
Beautiful state of mind, such a beautiful state of mind<eob>
Beautiful state of mind<eob>
Sometimes everyday right on time<eob>
But right now in my mind<eob>
It feels like I'm living on borrowed time<eob>
I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood<eob>
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood<eob>
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug<eob>
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a...<eob>
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?<eob>
Tell me you love me, need me<eob>

Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida<eob>
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her<eob>
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her<eob>

Oh my<eob>
Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me ?<eob>
God: What advice can I give humanity?<eob>
Atom: I suppose so<eob>
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all<eob>
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever<eob>
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour<eob>
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?<eob>
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one<eob>
One, two, three, four<eob>
One, two, three, four, listen<eob>
Look into my eyes<eob>
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on<eob>
This front that I'm puttin' up for you<eob>
I spill my soul into a microphone<eob>
With poems written in blood<eob>
In hopes that it's enough for you<eob>
Do you love me yet?<eob>
Do you love me yet?<eob>
No? Okay<eob>
I'll go harder for you<eob>
In fact, I rap till I collapse<eob>
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson<eob>
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own<eob>
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed<eob>
About the ways to raise a child up<eob>
To not become a product<eob>
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent<eob>
But I done built this wall up<eob>
Actin' like everything's all good<eob>
But in reality I'm lookin' for something<eob>
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after<eob>
Nas, Cole, and Hov<eob>
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'<eob>
I'm used to being alone<eob>
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?<eob>
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne<eob>
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along<eob>
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant<eob>
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in<eob>
And still then<eob>
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?<eob>
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap<eob>
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved<eob>
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs<eob>
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit<eob>
Be who you are, identify as a star<eob>
No one tells you you're that<eob>
It's something that you just know<eob>
The world be stealing your glow<eob>
Your mama did what she could<eob>
Her life was miles from good<eob>
Your father fell in the trap<eob>
They set for you when you black<eob>
They met when they was low<eob>
And therefore you a product of that<eob>
And so your trauma is deep<eob>
Don't bury it you should weep<eob>
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em<eob>
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace<eob>
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release<eob>
I've been through it before<eob>
Can only share with you what I know<eob>
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you<eob>
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try<eob>
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly<eob>
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky<eob>
But if you want to then you ought to know why<eob>
Are you running from something<eob>
With hopes of becoming someone<eob>
That's finally worthy of love<eob>
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough<eob>
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell<eob>
Find God, learn to accept yourself<eob>
And I'm gone, accept Him<eob>
Tell me how you feel—<eob>
I feel like the grass is green<eob>
And everything I do is unseen<eob>
But I know that’s just in my mind<eob>
I know everything is just in my mind<eob>
Do you really wanna to be famous?<eob>
Do you really wanna be a superstar?<eob>
Do you really wanna get dangerous?<eob>
Do you even know where the groupies are?<eob>
Bitches out here be shameless<eob>
And I really wonder where they parents are<eob>
Look around, everything changes<eob>
It feels like I've been buried alive<eob>
Everything happens for a reason<eob>
People only in your life for seasons<eob>
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)<eob>
Death and taxes that’s all we given<eob>
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'<eob>
You can make it work but that still ain't driven<eob>
Give a lot but that still ain't givin<eob>
Livin' life like this ain’t real though<eob>
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong<eob>
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone<eob>
Perception of right and wrong<eob>
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh<eob>
Look around everything changes<eob>
Seem like everybody just strangers<eob>
Don’t go outside cause it’s dangerous<eob>
Why everybody wanna be famous<eob>
I’m so OCD if they notice me<eob>
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me<eob>
Man everybody want this shit for free<eob>
Hand out palm up when they get to me<eob>
In my mind no I never let it get to me<eob>
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?<eob>
V’s up motherfucka, that’s victory<eob>
Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn<eob>
Buried alive (Buried alive)<eob>
Will I survive? (Buried alive)<eob>
I gotta know, I gotta know<eob>
It feels like I’ve been buried alive, buried alive<eob>
Tell me how you feel—<eob>
I feel like the grass is green<eob>
And everything I do is unseen<eob>
But I know that’s just in my mind<eob>
I know everything is just in my mind<eob>
Do you really wanna to be famous?<eob>
Do you really wanna be a superstar?<eob>
Do you really wanna get dangerous?<eob>
Do you even know where the groupies are?<eob>
Bitches out here be shameless<eob>
And I really wonder where they parents are<eob>
Look around, everything changes<eob>
It feels like I've been buried alive<eob>
(Let it breathe)<eob>
I'm feelin' this villainous feelin inside of my mind<eob>
Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams<eob>
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah<eob>
Listen up now, love it or hate it<eob>
Never debate it, you can never degrade it<eob>
While all these other motherfuckers<eob>
Probably thinking I made it<eob>
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it<eob>
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)<eob>
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now<eob>
RattPack put me on the map now<eob>
No, we never back down<eob>
Just take my time, I just take my time<eob>
I know, I'mma get it like this<eob>
So everyone know that I did it like this<eob>
Yeah, I know—I'mma take my time<eob>
Battle the image inside of my mind<eob>
I know, I'mma keep going<eob>
Tell me I can't but I'm already knowing<eob>
I know, I'm gonna rise even though I've been—<eob>
Buried alive (Buried alive)<eob>
Will I survive? (Buried alive)<eob>
I gotta know, I gotta know<eob>
It feels like I've been buried alive, buried alive<eob>
Tell me how you feel—<eob>
I feel like the grass is green<eob>
And everything I do is unseen<eob>
But I know that’s just in my mind<eob>
I know everything is just in my mind<eob>
(Let it breathe)<eob>
OutKast, A Tribe Called Quest, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and films by Quentin Tarantino were in rotation constantly throughout the duration of this album's creation...<eob>
It's the type of shit that they read about<eob>
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out<eob>
I've been in the zone, I can't be without<eob>
This real shit that I be about<eob>
I'm a visionary, that's long term<eob>
But Def Jam, said they need it out<eob>
If I rush this shit, I might be without<eob>
But I need a vision, can't see without<eob>
I've been patient, never complacent<eob>
Left the underground when I left the basement<eob>
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation<eob>
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G<eob>
Conversations with No I.D<eob>
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with Jay<eob>
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me<eob>
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be<eob>
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me<eob>
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be<eob>
It's so different now, everything is so different now<eob>
I've been there and I've done that<eob>
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact<eob>
And I'm back again cause I love this shit<eob>
Write it down and they publish it<eob>
I went 5 years without a publicist<eob>
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this<eob>
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming<eob>
Went away a while but I've been fiending<eob>
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal<eob>
Been at it way before the deal<eob>
Now the  music got mass appeal<eob>
My main girl got ass appeal<eob>
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing<eob>
Little fish, that went mainstream<eob>
Now I'm big as fuck<eob>
My whole city, they know what's up<eob>
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit<eob>
I don't give a fuck<eob>
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt<eob>
If I'm talking business, I might erupt<eob>
If you're at the show, put your lighter up<eob>
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it<eob>
Outsiders, I could do without it<eob>
I crept in, got slept on<eob>
Sold out shows, no one knew about it<eob>
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it<eob>
Your cosign, I could do without it<eob>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<eob>
Na, na, na, na, na, na...<eob>
Okay, last verse I gotta make it count<eob>
Won't speak on my bank account<eob>
So many commas I'd have to pause<eob>
And I can't afford to just waste the bars<eob>
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord<eob>
I got a lot of problems but could have more<eob>
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less<eob>
I been hungry like Budapest<eob>
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck<eob>
I just know I'm blessed<eob>
Love life even though I'm stressed<eob>
This business boy, I swear a test<eob>
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check<eob>
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck<eob>
I love the building, no disrespect<eob>
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect<eob>
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet<eob>
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist<eob>
I'ma intercept. It's my time<eob>
Put half a mill of my own money in this album<eob>
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes<eob>
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium<eob>
From the Roxy to Palladium<eob>
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that<eob>
With this pretty girl on my floor<eob>
Half naked playing Connect Four<eob>
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window<eob>
Just to connect more<eob>
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind<eob>
And then unwind with some slow head<eob>
All my homies like "go 'head"<eob>
Anyway, it's been a long time<eob>
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go<eob>
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for<eob>
How's that shit for an outro?<eob>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<eob>
Na, na, na, na, na, na...<eob>
This is my story, 'till the end<eob>
Na, na, na, na, na, na<eob>
Na, na, na, na, na, na...<eob>
This is my story, 'till the end<eob>
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<eob>
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<eob>
Yeah Yeah...<eob>
"Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them!<eob>
They may be misinformed about the truth, they may be misguided— somebody has led them on the wrong path!<eob>
A path of corruption and destruction! But yet, God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved..."<eob>
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<eob>
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<eob>
Yeah Yeah...<eob>
Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<eob>
Y-Yeah, Yeah Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah<eob>
Yeah Yeah...<eob>
This concludes the Under Pressure program...<eob>
It's 2 bars? Aight...<eob>
Motherfuckers wanna get famous bust guns and get dangerous<eob>
(dangerous)<eob>
Daddy graduated from Cambridge, money talks in every language<eob>
Real recognize that stainless, silver spoon what my aim is<eob>
Y'all don't know what that game is, y'all don't know what that, uh<eob>
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life<eob>
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come<eob>
Baby girl gon' be about that maternity life<eob>
If you do like my daddy then she gonna be single and alone<eob>
That maternity life for eternity life<eob>
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life<eob>
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right<eob>
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems<eob>
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them (ba-ba-ba-ba)<eob>
Take care of all of them like this, I might just go crazy all the way<eob>
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away<eob>
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us<eob>
Not a god damn thing but they brought us<eob>
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust<eob>
Outside run around with a gun to bust<eob>
Police looking for every one of us<eob>
Back then yeah all of that was fun to us<eob>
Had a little bit of money in the middle, let me hit 'em with a riddle<eob>
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not—<eob>
Not be the same—might not be the—<eob>
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<eob>
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<eob>
Ay, hey now boy?<eob>
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy<eob>
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac<eob>
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town<eob>
South Central with the gang, gang, gang<eob>
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat<eob>
Get the fuck up off your silver<eob>
Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average<eob>
They cutthroat yeah they savage<eob>
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)<eob>
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this<eob>
For the rest of my life, no question it's right<eob>
Waiting for the bus at a stop light<eob>
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes<eob>
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies<eob>
And hatred multiplies—mu-mu-mu-multi—<eob>
Multiplies, I said I can't take it<eob>
I remember wondering if I would ever make it<eob>
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident<eob>
I'm getting money for the hell of it<eob>
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate<eob>
Speaking for the people like a delegate<eob>
And when the situation's delicate<eob>
I execute it with the proper etiquette<eob>
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, I can't take the time to stop<eob>
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top<eob>
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop<eob>
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in<eob>
While the whole world spin for the dividend<eob>
But I'm in another system<eob>
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em<eob>
Why can't we relax and listen?<eob>
Stop spending money on things that glisten<eob>
I know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<eob>
I Know my mind is sober, but I'm so high, it's over<eob>
Ay, hey now boy?<eob>
You don't know nothing about this, right here boy<eob>
Chilling in Maryland, three niggas in a Cadillac lac-lac<eob>
You don't know nothin' bout that Chi town<eob>
South Central with the gat gat gat<eob>
Niggas in the projects, for them niggas tryna eat<eob>
Get the fuck up off your silver spoon<eob>
Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted<eob>
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted<eob>
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki<eob>
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly<eob>
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go<eob>
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto<eob>
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago<eob>
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die<eob>
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing<eob>
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh<eob>
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me<eob>
All that competition right there is dead to me<eob>
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages<eob>
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous<eob>
Boy, I've been feeling courageous<eob>
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages<eob>
Feels like I'm running through mazes<eob>
Everybody has they phases<eob>
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this<eob>
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it<eob>
One of the few that be killing it, uh<eob>
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living<eob>
On the road to success you know that I'm driven<eob>
But they didn't wanna publish it<eob>
But right now I'm on some other shit<eob>
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl<eob>
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme<eob>
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills<eob>
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would<eob>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone<eob>
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it, I'm gone<eob>
Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude<eob>
I look out of the window like goddamn, that's what I really do<eob>
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain<eob>
If I look back on it I would do it all over again<eob>
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in<eob>
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again<eob>
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor<eob>

Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane<eob>
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam<eob>
Oh my God, this is my jam<eob>
"May-December" by Mos Def<eob>

It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away<eob>
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am<eob>
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van<eob>
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala<eob>
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah<eob>
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers<eob>
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer<eob>
Put my everything into this shit<eob>
You know, I know you know this<eob>
Used to give a fuck what people thought<eob>
Hoping that they would notice<eob>
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive<eob>
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive<eob>
I can't believe you don't like Tarantino<eob>

Only growing and prevail<eob>

Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan<eob>
Haters gon' hate, that's the motherfuckin' sayin'<eob>
So much plaque up on my wall I need a dentist<eob>

RattPack the gang, we do it like that<eob>
Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to the first black man<eob>
Long ago before the white man<eob>
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand<eob>
Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to the first white man<eob>
At the very moment when they looked around and said<eob>
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"<eob>
Take it back, take it way back<eob>

"Why you always talk about being black?<eob>

That door you trying to open, you could shut that<eob>
Grip the gat, yeah that’s how I’ma buck back<eob>
Tell me what I am and what I know now<eob>
All this prejudice has got to go<eob>
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down<eob>
Come and see me when I am in yo' town<eob>
Practice what we preach before it go down<eob>
Practice what we preach before it go<eob>
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho<eob>

And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho<eob>
Will I have to get the gat? No, no<eob>
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho<eob>
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?<eob>
Take it back, take it way back<eob>

Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way way back to the first white man<eob>
At the very moment when they looked around and said<eob>
"Fuck it, I’ma steal this land"<eob>
Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to about 1990<eob>
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland<eob>
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born<eob>
To a black father and a white mother<eob>
Father that wasn’t there<eob>
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs<eob>
Same as his mom<eob>
(Way, way back)<eob>
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?<eob>
And I’m gonna tell you about how<eob>
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness<eob>
All he ever wanted was positivity<eob>
All he ever wanted to do was entertain<eob>
And this boy went through hell<eob>
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy<eob>
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have<eob>
All these black babies with black men but you racist<eob>
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is<eob>
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger<eob>
The kids at school callin' him a cracker<eob>
Identifying as black, looking as white<eob>
Being told what you can or can’t be<eob>
This kid went through everything<eob>
He went through...<eob>
He saw narcotics in the household<eob>
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped<eob>
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid<eob>
And he persevered while the whole world said<eob>
What they said?<eob>
Said you wouldn’t be shit!<eob>
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'<eob>
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing<eob>
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere<eob>
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity<eob>
See, he always saw things from two sides<eob>
He always saw things from two sides<eob>
He always knew that the message<eob>
Everybody was born equal<eob>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation<eob>
He knew that because he saw that<eob>
(Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way)<eob>
Because he was stripped and torn down<eob>
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated<eob>
And that did not know<eob>
And he was stripped and he was torn down<eob>
By his white side that did not know<eob>
These people that are ignorant<eob>
That cannot see the bigger picture<eob>
That must fight and kill and murder each other<eob>
But once again, all he ever wanted to do<eob>
Was spread a message of equality<eob>
For every man, woman, and child<eob>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation<eob>
(Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to the first)<eob>
Now imagine this child growing up<eob>
And seeing the craziest shit<eob>
Being a part of the craziest shit<eob>
Running around with the wrong people<eob>
Running around with guns and knives<eob>
And fighting and stealing and, and all this<eob>
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!<eob>
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right<eob>
And he knew that he needed to get away from it<eob>
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old<eob>
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself<eob>
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings<eob>
And then he would then come home<eob>
To about eight or nine hours of sleep<eob>
But spend four, five, six hours of that<eob>
Working on music, persevering<eob>
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror<eob>
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people<eob>
Just chanting his name<eob>
Hoping that it would happen<eob>
But the, but the, but the world said no!<eob>
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no<eob>
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka<eob>
No-no!<eob>
(Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to the first)<eob>
And he said fuck that<eob>
He said peace, love, and positivity<eob>
He said equality for all man<eob>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah<eob>
Now I want you to also imagine<eob>
People telling him that he did not live this life<eob>
“You just a white boy<eob>
You ain’t never experienced that shit<eob>
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there<eob>
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there<eob>
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household<eob>
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household<eob>
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside<eob>
Outside, outside, outside, outside<eob>
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”<eob>
(Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to the first black man)<eob>
And this young man persevered in spite<eob>
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be<eob>
(Take it back, take it way back<eob>
Take it way, way back to the first black)<eob>
And that man is here today, proud<eob>
A lover of all human beings<eob>
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah<eob>
And he’s here to say:<eob>
Even though we’re all born and created equal<eob>
We are not treated equally<eob>
There’s extremists on every side<eob>
And you should just do your best to live life<eob>
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe<eob>
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody<eob>
You can believe they’re going to hell<eob>
You can believe it’s not right<eob>
You can believe you’re superior, fine<eob>
Just stop killing each other<eob>
I wonder what it feel like<eob>
To do that shit in real life<eob>
And now I know I got it<eob>
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted<eob>
But it's still Visionary till the death of me<eob>
Yeah, I'm trynna make it but I gotta find the recipe<eob>
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me<eob>
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me<eob>
I'm trynna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me<eob>
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny<eob>
They do it for the limelight<eob>
But I make sure my rhyme's right<eob>
Waiting till the time's right<eob>
Smiling at my mom's like<eob>
Smiling at my mom<eob>
Smiling at my momma<eob>
Moët what we sipping now<eob>
We was never tripping now<eob>
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now<eob>
Cause they was over there, I was over here<eob>
They was too scared while I was facing my fears<eob>
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer<eob>
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers<eob>
I'm the man of the year, man of the year<eob>
Man of the year, man of the year<eob>
Man of the year, man of the year<eob>
They said I couldn't do it<eob>
Back when I was broke going through it<eob>
Till I got a deal, now they talking 'bout "I knew it"<eob>
But you wasn't there in the beginning<eob>
Nowhere to be found when I was down<eob>
But you show up when I'm winning<eob>
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming<eob>
I do it cause I love this shit<eob>
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-<eob>
And the whips with the rims still spinning<eob>
I been at it since the beginning<eob>
All these girls screaming "Logic"<eob>
But I wanna hear my real name<eob>
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man<eob>
Y'all act like I'm Superman<eob>
But I can feel pain<eob>
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane<eob>
Love it when they sing to us<eob>
Been shining what's bling to us<eob>
Yeah, over here<eob>

Man of the year, man of the year<eob>
Man of the year, man of the year<eob>

While they tell me I'm the man<eob>
Making music is the plan<eob>
Matter fact, you can call it plan B<eob>
Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy<eob>
And I be first to pop off -  infantry<eob>
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry<eob>
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree<eob>
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony<eob>
Uh, to my ears<eob>
I love it when they cheer<eob>
On the road to success, these haters in my rear<eob>
I got nothing to fear<eob>
Cause the whole team here<eob>
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)<eob>
You the man of the year, man of the year<eob>
Man of the year, man of the year<eob>
Man of the year, man of the year<eob>

But you ain’t focused on what's important: mentality, health Everybody in the world only want one thing, what's that?<eob>
Infinite power and a pocket full of wealth<eob>
Its like ohhh I'ma bring it back to the basics<eob>

People in the street going ape shit<eob>
Battling depression but nobody wanna say shit<eob>
I'ma bring it back to the basics<eob>
I'ma bring it back to the basics<eob>
I'ma get up, get on<eob>
That’s what I been on<eob>
Fuckin' with your mind, tryna turn shit on<eob>
But they want to paint me as a villain<eob>
Even though I’m here to open their mind<eob>
Through the rhyme of life<eob>
I gotta open their mind and design the right time<eob>
To make a decision and get in 'em like an incision<eob>
'Cause I'ma hit 'em and give 'em livin'<eob>
They wonder what I’m giving, I'ma never give in<eob>

I remember somehow, someway<eob>
I remember somehow, someway<eob>
I remember somehow, someway<eob>
I remember somehow, someway<eob>
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood<eob>
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars<eob>
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic<eob>
As my body began to fade<eob>
In this moment my mind was full of clarity<eob>
But my body insisted it was in danger<eob>
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine<eob>
But I was convinced that something was wrong<eob>
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to<eob>
Fall and fade away<eob>
My body grew weak<eob>
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety<eob>
I refused to believe this story<eob>
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me<eob>
I began to feel detached from reality<eob>
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass<eob>
I got blood work done<eob>
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail<eob>
The doctor said it was anxiety<eob>
But how could it be anxiety?<eob>
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?<eob>
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?<eob>
Derealization<eob>
The sense of being out of one’s body<eob>
I’m not here<eob>
I’m not me<eob>
I’m not real<eob>
Nothing is<eob>
Nothing but this feeling of panic<eob>
Nobody understands<eob>
Nobody knows the sufferings<eob>
This physical feeling<eob>
It can’t be anxiety<eob>
It can’t<eob>
Or can it?<eob>
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?<eob>
Yeah, of course<eob>
I’m so in control of my mind and my body<eob>
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state<eob>
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind<eob>
I am unhappy<eob>
Not with life<eob>
But with this feeling<eob>
I am scared, I am human, I am a man<eob>
But I look in the mirror and I see a child<eob>
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit<eob>
And they never did<eob>
And it scares me<eob>
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit<eob>
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me<eob>
No, no this feeling<eob>
This anxiety is nothing<eob>
I have anxiety<eob>
Just like you, the person I wrote this for<eob>
And together we will overcome this feeling<eob>
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge<eob>
That we are alive<eob>
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted<eob>
We will rejoice in this gift that is life<eob>
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given<eob>
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves<eob>
Starting with mental health<eob>
We will accept ourselves as we are<eob>
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror<eob>
We will accept ourselves<eob>
And live with anxiety<eob>
I know that you think this song is for you<eob>
I used to long for you and adore you<eob>
My life was just fine way back before you<eob>
Now when you reach out I just ignore you<eob>
Cause this ain't a love song (woah)<eob>
This is, "So long"<eob>
You did me so wrong for so long<eob>
For so long, for so long<eob>
No, I never thought I could live my life without you<eob>
All you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you<eob>
And so I doubt you<eob>
I doubt you even know what's on my mind<eob>
I said, I doubt you<eob>
I doubt you even know why I left you behind<eob>
I know that I've been living<eob>
I know that I've been living<eob>
I know that I've been living<eob>
I know that I've been living<eob>
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars<eob>
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars<eob>
In the city of stars, where there's flying cars<eob>
A brand new home for everyone and even life on Mars<eob>
This ain't a love song (woah)<eob>
This is, "So long"<eob>
You did me so wrong for so long<eob>
For so long, for so long<eob>
And so I doubt you<eob>
I doubt you even know what's on my mind<eob>
I said I doubt you<eob>
I doubt you even know why I left you—<eob>
Yeah, uh, yeah...<eob>
Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me<eob>
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me<eob>
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me<eob>
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me<eob>
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album<eob>
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome<eob>
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?<eob>
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow<eob>
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it<eob>
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated<eob>
I'mma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated<eob>
Bitch, I dominate it<eob>
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID<eob>
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E<eob>
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies<eob>
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me<eob>
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone<eob>
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise<eob>
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet<eob>
Fuck all these cats on the internet<eob>
I love hip hop and I hate hip hop<eob>
Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot<eob>
Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes<eob>
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break<eob>
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game<eob>
We all people, all equal—now let me let off, yeah<eob>
Now let me let off<eob>
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify<eob>
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by<eob>
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones<eob>
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone<eob>
Switch flows, fuck 'em up—play the game, run 'em up<eob>
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck<eob>
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal<eob>
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?<eob>
Racism on television and magazines<eob>
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn<eob>
Country don't give a fuck who I am<eob>
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand<eob>
And I am, here's to the Roc<eob>
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot<eob>
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop<eob>
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap<eob>
I am, livin' like I ain't got it<eob>
Spit the flow so robotic, man who gives a fuck about it<eob>
Maryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it<eob>
I love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it<eob>
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed<eob>

Hashtag pray for this, pray for that<eob>
But you ain’t doing shit, get away from that<eob>
Blame it on a black, blame it on a white<eob>
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim<eob>
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her<eob>
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!<eob>
Everybody wanna get high<eob>
Everybody wanna live life like they can’t die<eob>

I wish they would love me like I like they pictures<eob>
I wish I had bitches<eob>
I wish I had motivation to get money<eob>
Ain’t it funny, my rainy day would be sunny<eob>
If I had the vision of currency fallin' above from the sky<eob>
Fallin' above from the sky, listen up<eob>
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen<eob>
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen<eob>
Everybody think that the meaning of life is, life is<eob>
Everybody, everybody, woo<eob>

Oh, I know it’s hard, I know it’s hard like<eob>
I know that’s the reason you turn up at night<eob>
Livin' yo' life, just livin' yo' life<eob>
Can’t nobody tell you how to do it right<eob>
Come away with me, come away with me<eob>
Let me take you from this world of insanity<eob>
Come away with me, come away with me<eob>
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree<eob>

Tell you 'bout the old man<eob>
Had a change of heart and then fell back<eob>
Old man lived a long life<eob>
Walked around with a long knife<eob>
You ain't cut the white like Jesus<eob>
That Colombiana, that's mi hermanos (YUGH)<eob>
Look at the flick of that wrist<eob>
I'm feelin' like Leonardo<eob>
Let me paint a picture, I might need a bottle<eob>
On the road to success, I could feel the throttle<eob>
That Michelangelo, hundreds in the envelope<eob>
Tight shit when I write shit<eob>
And that old man had a change of heart<eob>
Wish he knew it back from the start like goddamn<eob>
Looked around, seen his wife on the ground<eob>
Military bussin' bullets all over the whole compound<eob>
Soon as he seen it, I swear it, I mean it, my members go quicker than vamonos<eob>
He dead, she dead, he in jail<eob>

Clockwise, counterclockwise, realest nigga in the top five<eob>
Other four ain't rap niggas, I'm just reppin' for the blow side<eob>
Yuugh, that's coastlines, Panama for the boat rides<eob>
Worth billions, and we ain't even need Showtime<eob>
Just money counters and kitchenwear<eob>
Condo with a bitch in there<eob>
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!<eob>
The Rollie's been the trophy since Hawaiian Sophie<eob>
Curry over Kobe, we shootin' niggas<eob>
Splash brothers with the coca, add in baking soda<eob>
Goodfellas to my niggas (Yuugh) all Ray Liottas<eob>
Shades of blue, I aim at you<eob>

Me and my team gotta intervene<eob>
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?<eob>
We live in a world where everybody want everything<eob>
Everybody want a better thing<eob>
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing<eob>
Man, the game been waiting for a better king<eob>
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King<eob>
Screaming "Money ain't a thing", cause it ain't<eob>
Man, I never knew that living out a dream<eob>
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace<eob>
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute<eob>
Not a single second chilling in my new place<eob>
Motherfuckers getting two-faced<eob>
Cause a brother finally eating<eob>
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates<eob>
You know I only got two traits<eob>
Drop hits, get money—run it<eob>
What the fuck is there left to talk about<eob>
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about<eob>
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out<eob>
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out<eob>
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen<eob>
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen<eob>
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition<eob>
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game<eob>
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name<eob>
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it<eob>
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it<eob>
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?<eob>
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it<eob>
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different<eob>
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it<eob>
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit<eob>
Not the people that been hating<eob>
They can suck my dick—run it<eob>
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one<eob>
I'ma go in...<eob>
Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey<eob>
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago<eob>
At the bottom of the Riviera<eob>
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era<eob>
I gotta beware of the people<eob>
But I take care of the people<eob>
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it<eob>
Been done had this in my pocket<eob>
I had to wait to unlock it<eob>
Open that locket and see the picture I painted<eob>
No, we ain't never acquainted<eob>
On the rise like a defendant<eob>
That was charged with possession like an exorcism<eob>
My division is solely my vision<eob>
God damn, can you feel it?<eob>
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it<eob>
Had a dream, can you feel it?<eob>
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit<eob>
Get up in it, make the shit infinite<eob>
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent<eob>
I've been at it like an addict<eob>
Never at the party like I'm democratic<eob>
'Lotta static on the radio<eob>
Fuck everything that they represent<eob>
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant<eob>
No never when I slide up in the spot<eob>
Just a youngin' in the game<eob>
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back<eob>
That was the mentality, never truly reality<eob>
Looking for validation<eob>
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation<eob>
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation<eob>
Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation<eob>
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up<eob>
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up<eob>
Man it's been a good ride up<eob>
Everybody want me to lace 'em<eob>
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—<eob>
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion<eob>
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding<eob>
Couple years back you ain't give a damn<eob>
Autographs off the plane whenever I land<eob>
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can<eob>
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em<eob>
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap<eob>
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it<eob>
Living life like this is so crazy, this world is amazing<eob>
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby<eob>
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh<eob>
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound<eob>
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here<eob>
Don't fuck around cause they kill here<eob>
This music, it kill fear<eob>
I use it, when I need to hear<eob>
Been there, done that<eob>
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back<eob>
Simple shit, man I'm done with that<eob>
Fake rap, take it back<eob>
My chain heavy, got a lot of money<eob>
My bitch bad, have fun with that<eob>
I've been there and don't want it back<eob>
If I see the bitch I might run it back<eob>
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long<eob>
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone<eob>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<eob>
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it<eob>
So what now? (So what now?)<eob>
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision<eob>
My division is the greatest that's around<eob>

Down in Manhattan, that's a multi-million dollar view<eob>
And I got it from rappin'<eob>
Damn everyone nappin' on the boy, heh, shit<eob>
I'm not a mad rapper, but what?<eob>

In your whip while you drive<eob>
I've been living life and I hope that you do the same<eob>
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame<eob>
Come on I've been through the game<eob>
'Bout time that they know my name<eob>
Numb it down for the pain, this music my Novocaine<eob>
Lord willin' we overcame, it's time to get over man<eob>
I've been around the world and back<eob>
And I swear it's all the same<eob>
And what I learned; a prophet don't do it for the profit<eob>
Gon' get off, check the topic<eob>
Watch me drop it, can you top it?<eob>
I don't know I've been at it on the low<eob>
Never did it like this here before<eob>
But I'm still here and I just hope<eob>
I'll make a difference, make a killin', Lord willin'<eob>
Lord willin', make a difference<eob>
Lord willin'—uh, Lord willin'<eob>
I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<eob>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<eob>
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<eob>
I don't understand what's happening<eob>
And so I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<eob>
And yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again<eob>
And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<eob>
I don't understand what's happening<eob>
So I tell em—<eob>
I guess I'm back at it; I ain't done, I ain't had it<eob>
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic<eob>
For this rap shit I'm an addict, but can't fuck with that dramatic<eob>
I've been busting my ass, they probably think it's automatic<eob>
Yes sir, I've done this shit before<eob>
Like your baby momma momma<eob>
I'ma tell 'em like it is, I'ma tell 'em like it is<eob>
Life ain't picture perfect, we use the negatives to develop<eob>
I'm well up, I'm way up<eob>
Nothing but net, fuck the layup, I'm way up<eob>
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions<eob>
Can't fuck with they delusions, I'm on that 101 cruisin'<eob>
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way<eob>
But no not quite like this, living like that<eob>
In a way, guess you could say made me wanna write like this<eob>
Not quite like this, on my level, I'm unique and I'm a rebel<eob>
Like you listening? I hope that you're listening<eob>
This feel like it's summertime; waiting for the bus<eob>
Number nine, through the city all alone<eob>
Not a worry, not your phone<eob>

And I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)<eob>
I don't understand what's happening<eob>

Don't know why your bitch wanna date me, but I can't fight that<eob>
Guess you ain't done shit for her lately, not on the right track<eob>
If I think that shit sound good, I gotta write that<eob>
Weed man knockin' on the door, I'll be right back<eob>
Pass the shit to 6ix, watch him light that<eob>
Hit the studio, record the shit, then mix the shit, then master it<eob>
And then we do the show and they recite that<eob>
Bitch, I'm right back, told 'em 'bout my life, told 'em 'bout my life<eob>
Told 'em I was broke as fuck too many nights<eob>
Now I see my name up on so many lights, but everybody prolly think this shit done happened, happened, happened<eob>
Overnight, people think this how this shit happened, but they never right<eob>

Somewhere this shit done got crazy<eob>
I've just been driving Ms. Daisy<eob>
With my hands on the steering wheel<eob>
And my eyes on the pavement<eob>
I give a fuck 'bout where they went<eob>

They talking 'bout no arraignment<eob>
Now I wonder where the rain went<eob>
I just been all in my mind, homies tell me I'm stressing<eob>
I been counting what's on my bucket list<eob>
And not on my blessings<eob>
I think it's time for a lesson, hold up, you better pay attention<eob>
I can't end up like my momma popping anti-depressants<eob>
My therapist think I'm crazy, well, shit, she probably does<eob>
All that stress I'm under, I wonder why I don't do drugs<eob>
Raised in a household full of killers and thugs<eob>
Shit, I've been in doubt so long, don't know who I was<eob>
But I know who I am, yes, I know who I is<eob>
Please pardon my grammar, Daisy vibing with this<eob>

That Bino the realest, uh, this beat made me kill it, uh<eob>
Her feet to the ceiling,,she said that she love me<eob>
She never said that in college,,3005 is our mileage<eob>
I'm in my lane like a Prius, because I'm moving in silence<eob>
You still ain't broke down yet?<eob>
All the flashing lights and a couple Crown Vic's<eob>
Wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left<eob>
Tell your nigga speed up, she don't wanna get left<eob>
Relationships look closer in that rearview<eob>
Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you<eob>
So now you gotta stop, park, put that shit in neutral<eob>
Yeah, you really love her, but is she worth your future?<eob>
Your Ciara, your Beyoncé, they'll be saying he got money<eob>
Think that Kim be with Kanye if he left drive in the driveway?<eob>
Yeah, I know who you are, yeah, I know who you is<eob>
We were driving together, when we met we were kids<eob>

Ninety on the high<eob>
I've just been driving Miss Daisy<eob>
I've just been driving Miss Daisy<eob>

I've just been driving Miss Daisy<eob>
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'<eob>
And the police they rushin'<eob>
Go to my head like concussion<eob>
I'd rather not have this discussion<eob>
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood<eob>
Where my mind, don’t know now<eob>
But I know where it was<eob>
I need Nikki, where is Nikki<eob>
Baby girl please come and get me<eob>
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that God is with me<eob>
This that baby mama drama<eob>
Give a fuck about a man I know I'ma<eob>
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun<eob>
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month<eob>
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt<eob>
That welfare check, check<eob>
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did<eob>
But I’m glad he did cause it made me strong<eob>
Made me help somebody with this song<eob>
Paint the picture of my life<eob>
Growing up what it was like<eob>
Section 8, grab a plate<eob>
Food for thought, gravitate<eob>
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away<eob>
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today<eob>
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that’s all I know<eob>
Just me and my homies, people that know me<eob>
Only ones that know<eob>
Around my way, living day by day<eob>
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs<eob>
Five-O with them K-9's<eob>
Manhunt when it's game time<eob>
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day<eob>
Now I’m running from the police<eob>
Don’t know how, but I got away<eob>
Selling weed to my homies<eob>
And a girl in the building that know me<eob>
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen<eob>
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean<eob>
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do<eob>
Such a youngin, such a fool<eob>
Now I’m breaking into school<eob>
Cause my homie told me to<eob>
What to do, what would you?<eob>
When will I lose my anonymity<eob>
And become one with the enemy?<eob>
Tell me would I be the enemy<eob>
Feel like nobody in front of me<eob>
I can feel the vibe<eob>
Bobby what are you thinking?<eob>
What are you dreaming about?<eob>
Bobby, what’s inside?<eob>
What are you thinking right now?<eob>
What are you thinking?<eob>
Go to sleep<eob>
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now<eob>
Cause when I wake up my dreams fade<eob>
Everything cascade<eob>
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames<eob>
Why must I open my eyes<eob>
I wish I could stay asleep forever<eob>
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever<eob>
Will it happen, maybe never<eob>
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why<eob>
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming<eob>
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?<eob>
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live<eob>
I can’t live it no longer<eob>
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive<eob>
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain<eob>
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain<eob>
Hello children, how was school?<eob>
It was good, how bout you?<eob>
I love you (I love you son), I love mama too<eob>
Are you ready for dinner?<eob>
I’m able to set the table<eob>
Till I snap out the fable when that TV turn off<eob>
And I realize I’m back in hell (Bobby...)<eob>

This is for every race<eob>
This is for every color, every creed<eob>
Music does not discriminate, music is made to assimilate<eob>
Black is beautiful, black is beautiful, and so are you<eob>
Strollin' down the highway, I’m strollin'<eob>

Hello?<eob>
I know, I know, I’m supposed to been home, I’m coming<eob>
Just, I’m on my way home, every time<eob>
I’m on my way there right now, okay?<eob>
Oh shit!<eob>
Life, what’s it all about?<eob>
What? Wait, where am I?<eob>
The space between spaces<eob>
Beyond time and existential intelligence<eob>
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?<eob>
What’s the last thing you remember, Atom?<eob>
I was in the store, I bought some smokes<eob>
I came outside, the phone rang, I...<eob>
How do you know my name?!<eob>
You were walking home from work when you died<eob>
Died? Dead? I’m dead? I’m dead?!<eob>
It wasn’t an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time<eob>
What do you mean it’s my time? What? I got...<eob>
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?<eob>
Your wife and son? You see, that’s what I like to hear<eob>
You find out you’re dead and the first thing you worry about is others<eob>
Man, answer me, what about my family?<eob>
What’s going on with Vanessa?<eob>
They’re doing just fine<eob>
You see, your wife was cheating on you<eob>
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!<eob>
And even though she loved you dearly<eob>
She was a bit relieved you would never find out<eob>
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?<eob>
How you gon' tell me I’m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!<eob>
Atom, none of that matters now<eob>
Walk with me<eob>
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?<eob>
No<eob>
Well, I don’t see no pitchforks<eob>
Little red people runnin' around<eob>
It ain’t too hot up in here so I guess this ain’t hell either<eob>
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void<eob>
Is to look upon it as a waiting room<eob>
So...are you God?<eob>
Yes, I’m God<eob>
You—you, you<eob>
You—you, you, you, you, you<eob>
You, you—you<eob>
You—you, you, you, you, you<eob>

Yeah, your girl fine as hell but she a Young Sinatra chick<eob>
Hey Bobby, how can you tell? She on the Young Sinatra dick<eob>
All these rappers wack as fuck, make the Young Sinatra sick<eob>
RattPack be the squad, that's that Young Sinatra clique<eob>
Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!<eob>
Listen, yeah—I’m visualizing the realism of life in actuality<eob>
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy<eob>
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy<eob>
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal<eob>
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal<eob>
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local<eob>
I'm loco from Noho to Soho<eob>
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho<eob>
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway<eob>
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day<eob>
One–way or another, my brother, word to your mother<eob>
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers<eob>
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!<eob>
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it<eob>
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it<eob>
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet<eob>
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker<eob>
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker<eob>
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker<eob>
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back<eob>
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up on the almanac<eob>
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again<eob>
Baskin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again<eob>
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this<eob>
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent<eob>
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's<eob>
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows<eob>
Money, talk, cash, hoes, greatest of levels–I've passed those<eob>
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)<eob>
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)<eob>
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)<eob>

I'm a bastard that mastered the flow<eob>
And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though<eob>
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no<eob>
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable<eob>
Like, saying the police isn't robbable<eob>
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face<eob>
Like, "Fuck the police!"—Blue lives ain't a race<eob>
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race<eob>
This shit a marathon<eob>
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on<eob>

Way back in the day trying to beat most<eob>
Anybody that wanna do what I do<eob>
Well let me keep it one hunnit with you<eob>
It ain’t about that; ain’t about Hip Hop, ain’t about Rap<eob>
Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap<eob>
Chicago, know I’mma snap<eob>
Nah, this ain't no basic rap<eob>
And so they wonder who am I—so high (so high)<eob>
I said they wonder who am I—so high<eob>
Back again, never outside so I’m acting in<eob>
I laugh again when they don’t understand<eob>
What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us<eob>
Everybody wanna live a life like this<eob>
Man fuck that, do what’s good for your family<eob>
Make music like there’s no Grammy<eob>
For that last line they might ban me<eob>
I don’t give a fuck though<eob>
'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami<eob>
I’mma just do what I do with my crew<eob>
Ain’t no telling what I’m finna do<eob>
But I promise that I’mma keep writing for you<eob>
And I know what to do, everything right here for you<eob>
Only for you, depending on what you gon' do<eob>
It’s all for you—it’s all for you<eob>
Who am I—so high (so high)<eob>
I said they wonder who am I—so high<eob>
Let me take this time to find the rhyme<eob>
And know that I’m the only one<eob>
To find the one, the time is done<eob>
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun<eob>
There is no one besides the only one<eob>
And you know I gotta let ‘em know<eob>
If you love it, let it go<eob>
At an all time low and all I know is, all I know<eob>
I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above<eob>
Created a world no one has been to<eob>
Everything that I’m into, everything that I’ve been through<eob>
Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light<eob>
Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight<eob>
Everybody probably wonder what I’m living like<eob>
In the middle of the night I might write<eob>
Despite what they say is right and wrong<eob>
Despite they wonder (wonder)<eob>
Who am I—so high (so high)<eob>
I said they wonder who am I—so high<eob>
We’d like to be painters, we’d like to be poets. We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can’t earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uhm—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...<eob>
You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...<eob>
But, it’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, we’re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up "their" children, to do the same thing. So, it’s all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it’s so important to consider this question...<eob>
"What do I desire?"<eob>
The Incredible True Story<eob>
And Transformation of the Man Who Saved the World<eob>
Surface contact in 400 meters...<eob>
300 meters...<eob>
200 meters...<eob>
Time of day is 6:28 Constant Meridian<eob>
328 feet...<eob>
Oxygen: 100%<eob>
Temperature is 17 degrees Celsius<eob>
Man... what are the chances that there’s some big-ass creature out there that’s going to eat us?<eob>
100%<eob>
(laughter)<eob>
Fuck...<eob>
Clear skies—<eob>
Kai, which Tarantino film do you think Logic liked best?<eob>
I would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill<eob>
114 feet—<eob>
Man, stylistically he’s like—what’s the name of that bitch? The lead character? I forgot her name, but he’s like that bitch—with like some Kung-Fu shit he’s like with his raps. It’s fucking crazy!<eob>
You know in—in Pulp Fiction I mean—the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it’s the same feel for me with his raps you know? There’s thought behind it...<eob>
No, I could see that, I could see that but...<eob>
But nah man, fuck that man! Kill Bill was the shit!!<eob>
Especially like knives throwing and dodging and shit—and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other’s heads off! What the fuck is that?!<eob>
Yeah, fuck it—<eob>
Prepare for surface landing!<eob>
You’re right, hot chicks and Kung-Fu, can’t beat that...<eob>
Yeah, can’t beat that at all...<eob>
Surface contact in:<eob>
10... 9... 8... 7... 6...<eob>
5... 4... 3... 2... 1!<eob>
Are you ready for this?<eob>
Are you?<eob>
(sounds of birds chirping, air, etc.)<eob>
Wait, wait—what's that sound?<eob>
(sounds grow, then abruptly stop)<eob>
Life...<eob>
Watch my back, so I make sure<eob>
You're right behind me as before<eob>
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow<eob>
Dry my eyes so you won't know<eob>
Dry my eyes so I won't show<eob>
I know you're right behind me...<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Yeah, I know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together<eob>
Thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather<eob>
I think about you and imagine a house and some kids<eob>
And wonder if you found another and it's all his<eob>
See baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies<eob>
Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes<eob>
Sometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl I know you hear it<eob>
My heart is calling for you tonight<eob>
And even though the time is wrong I know the love is right<eob>
That's why there's so much emotion whenever I recite<eob>
Anything about this angel that lost its sight<eob>
Baby you were my everything, but you playing games<eob>
Fucking around got me feeling like blowing my brains<eob>
But you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action<eob>
I used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
You were my best friend but then you out me<eob>
I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me<eob>
So in the end it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me<eob>
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep in this letter but I don't give a shit about what you think<eob>
I write it so that the people can feel better<eob>
That have gone through what I've gone through<eob>
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you<eob>
And if you think I write this song to taunt you<eob>
I don't want you, I want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday<eob>
And have an endless love with an angel from up above<eob>
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen<eob>
And another path within my life is calling<eob>
Cause I put everything below you, (everything below you)<eob>
Even my music, and when you left me I didn't lose it<eob>
I channeled deep within my emotions and used it<eob>
My heart you broke it and bruised it<eob>
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight<eob>
Watch my back, so I make sure<eob>
You're right behind me as before<eob>
Yesterday, the night before tomorrow<eob>
Dry my eyes so you won't know<eob>
Dry my eyes so I won't show<eob>
I know you're right behind me...<eob>
I am the greatest<eob>
(Someone with power, someone with power)<eob>

But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh<eob>
Dope in the trunk<eob>
Creepin out the cut<eob>
9 by the gut<eob>
Never get enough<eob>
I don’t give a fuck<eob>
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards<eob>
Mastered the hustle<eob>
Something in the duffle for you bastards<eob>
Grind over chatter<eob>
Cheese on my mind like a packer<eob>
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter<eob>
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K<eob>
Middle of the day, like that shit’s okay<eob>
Never had a job, never had a education<eob>
Only know probation<eob>
Never had a job never had a education<eob>
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one<eob>
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one<eob>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<eob>
Now send the blacks back to Africa<eob>
Build a wall for the Mexicans<eob>
Send the whites back to Europe<eob>
Give the land to the Native American<eob>
Take the skyscraper<eob>
Tear down the casino<eob>

Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch<eob>
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my<eob>
Hey mothafucka, I’m real as shit<eob>
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit<eob>
Aw yeah, I’m back in this bitch<eob>
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my<eob>
Various listeners is wishing us death<eob>
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath<eob>
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical agression<eob>
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression<eob>
When addressin' my profession in every session<eob>
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing<eob>
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'<eob>
What I'm about to say is highly confidential<eob>
And in the music industry today, very essential<eob>
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own<eob>
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on<eob>
Let's change the topic, who's your favorite rapper?<eob>
I'm the top pick, ha<eob>
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant<eob>
How many times must I say this?<eob>
Cock back and spray this, never delay this<eob>
I pray this, reaches the masses<eob>
And spread like cancer on they asses<eob>
Now allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like tech<eob>
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes<eob>
That buck that bought a bottle<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes<eob>
That buck that bought a bottle<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra<eob>
Whipin' through Cabo in a Murcielago<eob>
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago<eob>
The baddest Bobby soxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team<eob>
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing<eob>
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean<eob>
The way we (winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen<eob>
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend<eob>
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes<eob>
In layman's terms I disperse a verse you never seen<eob>
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene<eob>
While you in the alley playing dice<eob>
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist<eob>
Art thieves and jewel connoisseurs<eob>
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours<eob>
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated<eob>
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind<eob>
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes<eob>
That buck that bought a bottle<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes<eob>
That buck that bought a bottle<eob>
(Life's a bitch and then you die)<eob>
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra<eob>
Yo, Address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein<eob>
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan<eob>
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name<eob>
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pain<eob>
Whoever hate ‘em, I levitate 'em like David Blaine<eob>
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign<eob>
Bumpin' Santana in a finest Copacabana<eob>
In Havana with a honey by the name of Hannah<eob>
Wearing nothing but a bandana<eob>
Pussy wetter than Louisiana<eob>
You know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep it real<eob>
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic<eob>
I woke up early on my born day, I’m 20, it’s a blessing<eob>
The essence of adolescence leaves my body<eob>
Now I’m fresh and my physical frame is celebrated<eob>
Cause I made it one quarter through life<eob>
Some Godly-like thing created<eob>
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some<eob>
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from<eob>
My skull cause it’s pain in my brain, vein, money maintain<eob>
Don’t go against the grain, simple and plain)<eob>
I've been workin' like I've never been<eob>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<eob>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<eob>
What I know right now<eob>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<eob>
You ever wonder what it all really means?<eob>
Heart full of dreams?<eob>
I know I'ma do it, go get it by any means<eob>
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends<eob>
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems<eob>
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will<eob>
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill<eob>
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill<eob>
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will<eob>
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension<eob>
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention<eob>
You say you would if you had the money<eob>
Don't make me mention<eob>
That it'll cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention<eob>
Now don't get me wrong<eob>
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya<eob>
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya<eob>
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak<eob>
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak<eob>
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative<eob>
Talk all you want about me homie, I'ma let it live<eob>
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive<eob>
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative<eob>
Never been<eob>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<eob>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<eob>
What I know right now<eob>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<eob>
This is dedicated to everyone that never made it<eob>
And the people that persevered even though they was hated<eob>
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion<eob>
But on the real the road to success is prone to collision<eob>
And every now and then something happens<eob>
That's unexpected, like that newborn in your life<eob>
Because you fuckin' unprotected<eob>
And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't<eob>
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint<eob>
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can<eob>
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man<eob>
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow<eob>
Teach 'em everything I know<eob>
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe<eob>
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong<eob>
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song<eob>
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son<eob>
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun<eob>
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one<eob>
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run<eob>
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one<eob>
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one<eob>
I've been workin' like I've never been<eob>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<eob>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<eob>
What I know right you<eob>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<eob>
I've been workin' like I've never been<eob>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<eob>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<eob>
What I know right now<eob>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<eob>
I've been workin' like I've never been<eob>
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in<eob>
And if I knew back then what I know right now<eob>
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been<eob>
Um, you like that take? I like it<eob>
Yeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...<eob>
I think it's good, hey Bobby run it!<eob>
Church, yeah<eob>
Now this that—<eob>
Yeah, yeah<eob>
Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious<eob>
I wonder where is this, hold up<eob>
Get the fuck out my business, show enough<eob>
We roll up then load up<eob>
Just a bastard born out of wedlock<eob>
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock<eob>
Got my sites on deadlock<eob>
Visions of my enemy in a headlock<eob>
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble<eob>
Just a youngin' in trouble<eob>
Took a shot and then made it a double<eob>
Took a shot and then made it a double<eob>
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good<eob>
No ingredients in my hood<eob>
But a tablespoon of this baking soda<eob>
Gon' make it good, like it should<eob>
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait<eob>
Now take a look at my pigment<eob>
Tell me again, we can never be kin<eob>
Based on the color of my skin<eob>
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin<eob>
That's a club I don't wanna be in<eob>
My DNA get done integrated<eob>
My God it's innovative<eob>
That's a million miles away from administrative<eob>
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—<eob>
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park<eob>
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive<eob>
Police would knock on the door, I would hide<eob>
Then they would talk to me and I would lie<eob>
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45<eob>
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away<eob>
Over down on the driveway<eob>
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade<eob>
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that "My Way"<eob>
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn<eob>
Now I'm a grown man, oh man<eob>
What the fuck done happened to the plan<eob>
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)<eob>
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)<eob>
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker<eob>
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too<eob>
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal<eob>
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel<eob>
My son, my seed watch 'em grow and then watch 'em lead<eob>
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot<eob>
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot<eob>
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me<eob>
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC<eob>
Follow me to paradise<eob>
Follow, follow me<eob>
Follow me to paradise<eob>
Follow me to paradise<eob>
Follow, follow me<eob>
Follow me to paradise<eob>
I remember my life long ago in my adolescence<eob>
I could feel the presence in my residence<eob>
Hesitant even thought it was evident<eob>
I should get the fuck—<eob>
I know something is wrong<eob>
Yeah, I know something is wrong<eob>
Feel like my mind gone<eob>
I know I play along, I might drown in this song<eob>
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this<eob>
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice<eob>
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed<eob>
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not<eob>
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious<eob>
So outrageous my age is on my mind<eob>
Walking to work and I go blind<eob>
Sippin' on that Koolaid<eob>
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée<eob>
Look around and see people with no class<eob>
Like snow on a school day<eob>
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do<eob>
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu<eob>
Livin' life how I do is crazy<eob>
This shit never amaze me<eob>
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why<eob>
All I know is my mind racing<eob>
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it<eob>
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again<eob>
Been here since way back when<eob>
Now let that shit begin, yeah<eob>
This album 2 but this song was written before the first<eob>
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst<eob>
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise<eob>
But it only makes it that much better when I rise<eob>
This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it<eob>
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming "I knew it!"<eob>
This is real, so real<eob>
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill<eob>
Most of these people will never hit fruition<eob>
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition<eob>
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle<eob>
All alone with no one to dial<eob>
I'm just a man, I got problems<eob>
Understand, this is all I ever wanted<eob>
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect<eob>
I've questioned if this life was even worth it<eob>
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface<eob>
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done<eob>
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now<eob>
This album 2 but this song was written before the first<eob>
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst<eob>
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise<eob>
But it only makes it that much better when I rise<eob>
Yeah, yeah, SlayDro!<eob>
This that J Dilla right here<eob>
Badu, Indica Badu<eob>
Yeah, that's right...<eob>
Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees<eob>
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right<eob>
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash<eob>
Come now, let me count this cash<eob>
Come now, let me sip this flask<eob>
Pockets fat like shawty ass<eob>
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas<eob>
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition<eob>
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate<eob>
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate<eob>
All this shit that's on my plate<eob>
That food for thought that can't be bought<eob>
But only taught, and on the real know<eob>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<eob>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<eob>
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier<eob>
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it<eob>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<eob>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<eob>

Tell them open that door but don't peek in<eob>
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'<eob>
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason<eob>
Eyes so low from the chiefin'<eob>
I be getting high when I wake up<eob>
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping<eob>
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past<eob>
It don't even come to my house<eob>
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag<eob>
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip<eob>
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip<eob>
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)<eob>
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'<eob>
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in<eob>
You been rolling with cats, who boring<eob>
I be bringing them stacks enormous<eob>

Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported<eob>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<eob>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<eob>

I can't get much higher—<eob>
Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling<eob>
Independent feeling like a boss<eob>
Roll a little something, smoke a little something<eob>
Kick back and then floss<eob>
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost<eob>
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain<eob>
Man, you know how much that shit cost?<eob>
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket<eob>
No, I am only talking about the mind<eob>
When the cannabis combine with the brain<eob>
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine<eob>
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great<eob>
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint<eob>
Stack of money in the bank<eob>
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang<eob>
They know the face and they know the name<eob>
I'm a married man with a bad wife<eob>
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane<eob>
Come play the game, honestly never the same<eob>
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion<eob>
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo<eob>
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire<eob>
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me<eob>

Yeah, and if you don't know by now—I smoke weed!<eob>
"Hahahaha," how Wiz gonna give me the verse<eob>
He ain't gonna give me the laugh though?<eob>
"Hahahaha," that shit iconic<eob>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Indica Badu<eob>
Aye, let me just rap...<eob>
I've upgraded while they've waited<eob>
Will they love it?, Will they hate it?<eob>
Never faded I evade it<eob>
Cause I never really want to complicate it<eob>
Think I've made it, yes I did<eob>
I'm giving them bars like a bid<eob>
Let me rewind it like a vid<eob>
"Did he just say that?" Yes, I did<eob>
And they really wanna get it like I live<eob>
God damn mother fucker what I gotta give<eob>
Way back in DC, at Liv<eob>
On the way to that everlasting life<eob>
Will they rob you? Yeah, they might<eob>
Hold up, wait a minute, veer to the right<eob>
On this road to success, I've faced my fears<eob>
Then hop on that flight<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
My bitch bad got a sick figure<eob>
Play 1 show and get 6 figures<eob>
We build bigger, money tall as a mountain, bitch<eob>
I've got Hilfigers, like goddamn<eob>
Yes sir, I know who I am<eob>
I'm that main man Martin, out here kicking out Pam<eob>
Just riding 'round with my Gina in that all-black Beamer<eob>
All the way from Maryland whipping out West Covina<eob>
Hold up, now check my demeanor<eob>
Yeah, your girl bad, my girl meaner<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've got the Akira on the wall<eob>
I just can't follow their law<eob>
Swear to God that they know me<eob>
They don't know me at all<eob>
And its all right, it's alright<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
Let me bring in them new kicks like Timbaland<eob>
I gotta reboot with this upgrade<eob>
My metaphors on Cloud 9<eob>
And the meaning behind them is so vague<eob>
Before I created this universe<eob>
I had to fly through the Bermuda first<eob>
6ix on the beat, then we queue the verse<eob>
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge<eob>
Feel like I'm in a Fifth Element<eob>
I'm in my element lost in paradise<eob>
Its me, you and Leeloo, Korben Dallas in Fhloston Paradise<eob>
Never by chance like a pair of dice<eob>
I don't give a fuck about their advice<eob>
I'm on another planet, no I'm not manic<eob>
Bitch I'm decompressed, know they can't stand it<eob>
Cause I pilot it and manned it the best<eob>
All they demanded was I gave up and laid dream to rest<eob>
(God damn!) Hold up, wait a minute; fuck all that shit<eob>
I left Earth ages ago to avoid and duck all that shit<eob>
You know when we on<eob>
Making music that's gon' survive for eons<eob>
Bloodshed from America to Sierra Leone<eob>
That's that shit I can't be on, that's the reason I be gone<eob>
Yes, I keep it professional like Luc Besson and Leon<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
I've upgraded<eob>
Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time<eob>
I think about specific moments that I could rewind<eob>
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide<eob>
And truly understand the deeper things<eob>
That I don't know about<eob>
Now take a trip with me and vibe<eob>
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?<eob>
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe<eob>
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive<eob>
I'm gonna take this moment right now<eob>
Here and school them people<eob>
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal<eob>
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people<eob>
Truly wish that I could, check it<eob>
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world<eob>
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world<eob>
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters<eob>
All different colors and creeds all come together for me<eob>
Boy, I'm blessed to be free, uh<eob>
This is our time<eob>
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind<eob>
This is our ride<eob>
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind<eob>
Doing 70 on this highway<eob>
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open<eob>
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping<eob>
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in<eob>
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit<eob>
It's been like 3 months since I've been home<eob>
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone<eob>
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on<eob>
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it<eob>
Let me bring 'em back<eob>
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever<eob>
My endeavor like a feature film<eob>
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?<eob>
I'm in it, my limit the chillest<eob>
Let me bring 'em back, yo<eob>
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing<eob>
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing<eob>
But I'm testing, reminiscing<eob>
When I would listen to my intuition<eob>
And now I made it, resurrecting<eob>
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated<eob>
It seem like everyone's somehow related<eob>
Letters back and forth from my homie<eob>
That's locked up in prison<eob>
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him<eob>
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man<eob>
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in<eob>
What if the tables was turned<eob>
And I was the one that been in, damn<eob>
He said he's seen me in the magazine<eob>
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel<eob>
That's been my dog from the kennel<eob>
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one<eob>
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun<eob>
Skipping class with all of my homies<eob>
On a constant search for who I was<eob>
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because<eob>
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs<eob>
I never graduated but I made it to the summit<eob>
Don't get me wrong, so many times<eob>
I thought that I would plummet<eob>
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem<eob>
To stomach all of the beef around my way<eob>
I mean, I never wanted to live a life<eob>
Where all you're truly living is a lie<eob>
I knew I always wanted more<eob>
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why<eob>
This is our time<eob>
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind<eob>
This is our ride<eob>
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind<eob>
So what do you think about space?<eob>
Um, space is called the galaxy...<eob>
Do you know planets?<eob>
What are—can you name some planets off?<eob>
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth<eob>
Mars—and the planet Paradise<eob>
You've never been there before?<eob>
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—<eob>
But there was droid ships everywhere...<eob>
Well, thank you for your time, sir<eob>

Come now, you know what I mean<eob>
Pepe done got the boy lean<eob>

Hold up, wait up, just can't believe<eob>
Just can't believe that my swag is on another level<eob>

Don't matter who come stand next to me<eob>
Once I'm surrounded ain't nobody fuckin' with them<eob>
I am the best of the best, of the best<eob>
Of the best, of the best, of the best like, Men In Black<eob>

Yeah, I was born at the bottom (yeah, yeah, yeah)<eob>
Everything I'm given now<eob>
This is real life, the only one we get to live<eob>
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give<eob>
This is real life, everything we do is legendary<eob>
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery<eob>
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming<eob>
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning<eob>
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life<eob>
Yeah, I've been fiending for this moment<eob>
I've been dreaming 'bout this moment<eob>
I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted<eob>
Writing these records like a dissertation<eob>
While the fans goin' crazy from anticipation<eob>
Damn, nine years that's a lot of patience<eob>
And now I'm looking at my idols and feeling adjacent<eob>
It's hell of a long way from back in the basement<eob>
Looking at hip-hop tryna find my placement<eob>
I bought my first pair of Jordans at 22<eob>
Same year I bought a crib too<eob>
Now my face in magazines I used to flip through<eob>
And my music on all the sites I used to sift through<eob>
Remember meeting Nas for the first time<eob>
Shook his hand and he started quoting my lines<eob>
Said he a fan, goddamn this is my time<eob>
I'ma get it, I'ma do it till we prime time<eob>
I told him every single day that I be at it<eob>
In the studio recording like an addict<eob>
He said that real hip-hop shit I had it<eob>
Thinking to myself, "Damn, man, you made Illmatic"<eob>
This is real life, the only one we get to live<eob>
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give<eob>
This is real life, everything we do is legendary<eob>
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery<eob>
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming<eob>
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning<eob>
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
Aight, I guess we back again<eob>
With another verse about how much I'm black again<eob>
You don't like it blame God for the packaging<eob>
Bringing up my race, don't call me a white rapper then<eob>
Damn, they judging me by my skin tone<eob>
Instead of my talent, man these motherfuckers been wrong<eob>
But it's all good I just thought I'd address it<eob>
And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it<eob>
This is dedicated to anyone with a dream<eob>
And a realization of what following it means<eob>
Breaking the cycle and not following your genes<eob>
That perfect moment when your logic intervenes<eob>
And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems<eob>
But if you really looking, I promise you'll find your dreams<eob>
This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it<eob>
The other half will probably laugh and wonder how I did it<eob>
I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time<eob>
Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme<eob>
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders<eob>
But this is my therapy as I flow this<eob>
Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice<eob>
I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers know this<eob>
Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated<eob>
But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares<eob>
People watching every move I make like it was theirs<eob>
All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs<eob>
Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't trynna sell you<eob>
Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you<eob>
And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through<eob>
We kept it moving, assuming even the greatest fail too<eob>
I swear this business shit is do or die<eob>
I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive<eob>
In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I<eob>
And everyday fewer find their dreams because fewer try<eob>
This is real life, the only one we get to live<eob>
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give<eob>
This is real life, everything we do is legendary<eob>
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery<eob>
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming<eob>
Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning<eob>
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life<eob>
Everything I seen, made me everything I am<eob>
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine<eob>
Throw your hands in the air, stand behind mine<eob>
Everything I seen, made me everything I am<eob>
Stand behind mine<eob>
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine<eob>
Said, welcome to forever<eob>
Welcome to forever<eob>
Welcome to... forever...<eob>
Yeah, yeah<eob>
Yeah, yeah<eob>
Cannon<eob>
It’s funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model<eob>
At the hotel, asking for mo' bottles<eob>
Ménage et plus one - I’m fucking fo' models<eob>
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle<eob>
Murci-lago, whipping through Chicago<eob>
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go<eob>
Million-dollar deals on the table<eob>
Just a couple years ago I couldn’t pay for cable<eob>
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel<eob>
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label<eob>
Plus Def Jam, know who I am<eob>
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can<eob>
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach<eob>
I’ve got information that the school system doesn’t teach<eob>
I've got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach<eob>
Second-coming-of-Christ flow, they like, "Whoa!"<eob>
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul<eob>
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull<eob>
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine<eob>
Just me and a mic on a main stage, spazzing<eob>
It’s the type of shit normal people can’t even fathom<eob>
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasms<eob>
I’m hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth<eob>
I’m resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus<eob>
Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy<eob>
Man, this industry is so damn greasy<eob>
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy<eob>
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy<eob>
21st century, doing something mean to it<eob>
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it<eob>
"Greatest of all time" has got a nice ring to it<eob>
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us<eob>
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us<eob>
Most loved, most hated at the same time<eob>
Star player in this bitch and it's game time<eob>
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?<eob>
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name<eob>
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine<eob>
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down<eob>
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around<eob>
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate<eob>
‘Cause y’all just watched the throne, I’m tryna checkmate<eob>
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and<eob>
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it’s so astonishing<eob>
Y’all better swallow that pride like a klonopin<eob>
Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, Chinaman<eob>
Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday<eob>
Looking at the BET cypher like I’ll be there one day<eob>
It’s the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary<eob>
Fuck the world ’til I’m on top, we call that missionary<eob>
The game’s on pause, it need to load again<eob>
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again<eob>
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot<eob>
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB<eob>
Now you see me on the TV<eob>
Said this would happen back in the day but you ain’t believe me<eob>
So um, I'mma keep rising to the top<eob>
Never stop and finger fuck the world ’til the day my album drop<eob>
You already know what I been on<eob>
You know where I be at<eob>
Cause men lie, women lie<eob>
Numbers don't, I see that<eob>
Catch me in a private jet<eob>
Like fuck it where the weed at?<eob>
And this flight attendant got the fattest ass<eob>
You know I need that<eob>
Now these bitches say they love me, but they're just obsessed with the image<eob>
Now if practice makes perfect then this is a scrimmage<eob>
Cause I ain't perfect, I never said I was<eob>
But now they're hating cause a brother finally got some buzz<eob>
The things that I say (Say)<eob>
The places I'm seeing (Seeing)<eob>
The people I talk to you don't know what I mean<eob>
Even matters of love, it ain't always as it seems<eob>
Yeah there's plenty in the sea until you hit the mainstream<eob>
The girl that I love, the one I call my honey<eob>
Now I wonder if she love me for me or my fucking money<eob>
Sometimes I think about the love that I had in the past<eob>
I truly miss it but it just wasn't destined to last<eob>
Cause our separation lit a fire under my ass<eob>
And now I'm gunning for the throne yeah that is my task<eob>
Just a youngin' with a dream, that acquired a team<eob>
Motivated by bad bitches and rockin' supreme<eob>
Now the whole world wonders what's his next move<eob>
That all depends on what I feel that I need to improve<eob>
Tell me what you think of me I swear it doesn't matter<eob>
Just as long as I am happy and my pocket's getting fatter<eob>
Just watch me shatter the competition<eob>
Getting madder then all of them wishing<eob>
You couldn't done it like I done it bitch I run it, Ah!<eob>
Yeah you know I do it like it ain't never been done<eob>
Hit the Vegas strip and blow a million euro just for fun<eob>
To be honest I may have embellished that last line<eob>
Chillin' with a shorty that is so much more than fine<eob>
At the penthouse poppin' bottles of that hundred thousand dollar wine<eob>
I got the connect, met 'em through the grape vine<eob>
You know what I been on<eob>
You know where I be at<eob>
Cause men lie, women lie<eob>

You know what I been on<eob>
You know where I be at<eob>
Yeah, it's been a year and everything I said would happen, has<eob>
New school style with old school bars like Alcatraz<eob>
Cause I ain't never second guess this music shit<eob>
I knew this shit was all I ever wanted, all I ever had<eob>
Born famous now it's just time to convince the world<eob>
Ditch cats, like drainage if they disrespect it don't step through<eob>
I paint pictures for your mind and bring it to life like cinematography<eob>
Say it then I do it my whole career's a prophecy now<eob>
Better grab your jacket, cause in this world we live in it's cold out<eob>
And when my album hit the stores it's sold out<eob>
Like these rapper's careers<eob>
I'm the sum of our fears<eob>
Fuck a Grammy nominated bitch, I made it and I'm here<eob>
I said it's all about the fans, not all about the record sells<eob>
They said it wouldn't work, I told them go fuck themselves<eob>
Why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail<eob>
Why-why you think I'm independent visionaries never fail<eob>
You know what I been on<eob>

Break it down for these motherfuckers thinking that they<eob>
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with me now<eob>
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with me now<eob>
Yeah, smoking in London while the snow fall<eob>
In another country so pardon me for the roll call<eob>
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense<eob>
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french<eob>
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out<eob>
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese<eob>
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, "bitch please, what up?"<eob>
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse<eob>
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse<eob>
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me (Biggie)<eob>
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me<eob>
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental<eob>
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental<eob>
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental<eob>
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel<eob>
My ex hit me talkin bout she wanna make up<eob>
But on the real, I got no time for cover girls<eob>
Music is my main bitch, no time for other girls<eob>
I'm finna blow like Hiroshima, my demeanor get meaner<eob>
Watch me elevate to arenas<eob>
Me without the mic, that's like<eob>
Martin without the Gina, Venus without Serena<eob>
Now these thirsty bitches on the dick, we call that Aquafina<eob>
I used to bus tables until them tables turned<eob>
And everything I have obtained is everything I've earned<eob>
And everything I rap about is everything I've learned<eob>
So hopefully the listener can position a situation where they don't get burned<eob>
And they can learn from my mistakes, like I've learned from the greats<eob>
To do whatever it takes, for Heaven's sakes open your mind<eob>
This shit's one of a kind, elegant and refined, irrelevant to the swine<eob>
What's the deal?<eob>
Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville, on the real<eob>
To various people I do appeal, because of skill<eob>
So this the type of shit I'm gon keep making<eob>
That make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon<eob>
Rest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers<eob>
Never Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya<eob>
Allow me to open up your mind and mold ya<eob>
Indulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renaissance<eob>
The system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance<eob>
Cause all you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense<eob>
I'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again<eob>
Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin<eob>
It's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you<eob>
That's ignant<eob>
Ain't seen my momma in a minute<eob>
Cause growing up she called me a nigga<eob>
That would never amount to nothing<eob>
Racism from my own momma, left home cause of drama<eob>
But I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama<eob>
You ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story<eob>
You don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory<eob>
Fuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel<eob>
You wasn't with me as a child<eob>
Never once did you feel the pain of my stomach<eob>
That manifested from the lack of meals<eob>
Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels<eob>
We aim to keep it real<eob>
And hell no we ain't never missing<eob>
Came a long way from eating when government gave permission<eob>
If you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen<eob>
Just an outkast with a mission to spit to whoever listen<eob>
Bitch it's Logic!<eob>
Aight, well—higher probably, right?<eob>
Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?<eob>
One, two...<eob>
I just wanna make these music lovers remember again<eob>
While the haters fall back like September again<eob>
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again<eob>
Drop the politics and bring us together again<eob>
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then<eob>
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah, yeah<eob>
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week<eob>
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak<eob>
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces<eob>
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places<eob>
I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate<eob>
And even though it gets hard I know my fate<eob>
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight<eob>
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like<eob>
I'ma get up today<eob>
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way<eob>
Looking for the sun in a world of gray<eob>
Feeling like my dream is a world away<eob>
I'ma get up today<eob>
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way<eob>
Searching for the sun in a world of grey<eob>
Feeling like my dream is a world away<eob>
What it feel like?<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
Yeah, used to wonder what it<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
But now, I know, achieved the goal<eob>
I ran the race, I won the gold<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
But now, I know, achieved the goal<eob>
I ran the race, I won the gold<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
But now, I know, achieved the goal<eob>
I ran the race, I won the gold<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
But now, I know, achieved the goal<eob>
I ran the race, I won the gold<eob>
I used to wonder what it feel like<eob>
You can really do anything<eob>
You can really do anything<eob>
You can really do anything<eob>
You can really do anything<eob>
Hello. Welcome to the 'Under Pressure' program<eob>
My name is Thalia. I will be here to assist you with the information about the album and its creation<eob>
Logic<eob>
I got a date with destiny<eob>
My heart says yeah but can’t convince the rest of me<eob>
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe<eob>
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me<eob>
I need redemption no need to mention my past<eob>
Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash<eob>
The glitz, the glamor, the lights, the camera, the action<eob>
The stage, the fans, the speakers blasting<eob>
You know I want it, I need it<eob>
Don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it<eob>
This is everything I dreamed of<eob>
It’s everything I’ve ever wanted<eob>
But is it really truly in my plans<eob>
Or did God mix up my blueprints?<eob>
Did he have it right there in his hands?<eob>
Anybody give me a hint<eob>
I can feel it now I know it’s coming<eob>
And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say<eob>
I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission<eob>
Incarceration through these bars created a prison<eob>
And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given<eob>
25 to life yeah that’s how I’m living<eob>
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it<eob>
But there’s only way I'ma know<eob>
I’m like a seed planted in the dirt<eob>
Feels like I’ve been waiting forever to grow<eob>
And maybe today is the day<eob>
And maybe tonight is the night<eob>
But one thing that I know for sure<eob>
This time I’ma get it right<eob>
Logic, Logic, Logic, Logic<eob>
I want what I want how I want when I want it<eob>
I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted<eob>
I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man<eob>
Fuck a brother man<eob>
I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man<eob>
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man<eob>
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman<eob>
In the hood I’m a better man<eob>
Wish a mothafucka would, would<eob>
Whole life I been up to no good<eob>
Change it all if I could<eob>
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t<eob>
I’m a sinner, not a saint<eob>
Layers to my life, no I can’t<eob>
Cover it up with paint<eob>
Keep on livin', livin'<eob>
Livin' on money and women<eob>
As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out<eob>
Now the truth never come out my mouth<eob>
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like<eob>
I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin<eob>
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin<eob>
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me<eob>
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me<eob>
People try but don’t know 'bout me<eob>
But the Devil said that he want my soul<eob>
But the Devil said that he want my soul<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Somebody save me<eob>
I need you to save me<eob>
To wash away my sins on high<eob>
I’d rather be a different man in another world<eob>
Than work for the man in my universe<eob>
Wonder what it feel like to take flight<eob>
Momma told me everything gon' be alright<eob>
I mean my life can’t be off right<eob>
But come to think about it<eob>
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white<eob>
Can you mothafuckas see alright?<eob>
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it<eob>
Every day tragic<eob>
If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic<eob>
On this I know<eob>
I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know<eob>
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!<eob>
Love it or hate it, I made it<eob>
I did it, I lived it<eob>
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!<eob>
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey<eob>
Really wonder what the remedy<eob>
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?<eob>
Got me feelin like the enemy<eob>
Like I ain’t got no energy<eob>
I been lookin' for an entity<eob>
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity<eob>
Fuck all that<eob>
I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life<eob>
A waste of skin<eob>
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin<eob>
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me<eob>
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me<eob>
People try but don’t know 'bout me<eob>
But the Devil said that he want my soul<eob>
But the Devil said that he want my soul<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Give it to me right now<eob>
Somebody save me<eob>
I need you to save me<eob>
To wash away my sins on high<eob>
I know my life was lived the wrong way<eob>
I know I did you wrong in my own way<eob>
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized<eob>
That hypnotized the only<eob>
Part of me you loved<eob>
Part of me that had the strength to rise above<eob>
Part of me you know<eob>
Part of me you love more than to let it go<eob>
Dear God, I just wanna know why<eob>
Why do you put us here?<eob>
Why do you put us below?<eob>
Why do you put us subservient?<eob>
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?<eob>
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out<eob>
We betray each other<eob>
We lie, we take from one another<eob>
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end<eob>
But the state don't forgive us<eob>
I'm locked up and half my friends<eob>
And then when I get out, or I make it out<eob>
I'm expected to somehow give back<eob>
To people who never wanted to see me escape<eob>
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror<eob>
And it's gettin' clearer<eob>
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom<eob>
So, if you real, if you're out there for real<eob>
Please explain to me why<eob>
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?<eob>
And why do the people<eob>
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?<eob>
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right<eob>
But tonight, I am in this church<eob>
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me<eob>
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do<eob>
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down<eob>
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up<eob>
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame<eob>
And all I wanna do is believe in you<eob>
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt<eob>
And they make sure it hurts<eob>
And I am tired of hurtin', man<eob>
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared<eob>
So if you out there, do something about this<eob>
'Cause I can't take it no more<eob>
Help me<eob>
